# Markdown files for G&S Archive

Source code for files in the [Gilbert and Sullivan Archive](https://gsarchive.net/).

Files in this repository are considered authoritative. The corresponding HTML
files will be rebuilt as needed, and should not be manually edited. Any file
in the main web site directory which does NOT have a corresponding Markdown
file here is its own entity and is authoritative.

To build and test locally:

* Install Ruby
* gem install bundler
* bundle install
* bundle exec jekyll serve

It should auto-detect changes to Markdown or layout files. If you change the
configuration in _config.yml, restart Jekyll.

To make the site available on the LAN, add your local IP: `-H 192.168.0.123`

TODO: Allow the target file name to be customized, just in case:

    ---
    destination: foo/bar/index.htm
    ---

Otherwise it should be the same path as the .md file but with .html. It may be
of value to be able to specify redirects too, which would be autogenerated.
Not sure what the best way to handle current files beginning .htm is. Worst
case, we can always embed something into the file, and have build.py recognize
it and change the name appropriately, but then it has to read every file.
