Gilbert and Sullivan's eighth collaboration, _Princess Ida; or, Castle Adamant,_ opened on
5&nbsp;January 1884 at the Savoy Theatre and ran for 246 performances. To create the
libretto, Gilbert turned to a play he had written in 1870 entitled _The Princess_, and reused
much of that play's dialogue and retained its three act structure but he wrote new lyrics for
Sullivan to set. Sullivan provided some of the best music he ever wrote for the Savoy.

Both the play and the opera draw on characters and incidents in Tennyson's blank verse
narrative poem, _The Princess_, which had been published in 1847.

Prince Hilarion has been married in babyhood to Princess Ida, daughter of King Gama. The
Princess, however, has set up a college for women from which all men are barred. Hilarion and
his friends infiltrate the castle and ultimately the men, led by Hilarion's father, King
Hildebrand, stage a full-scale invasion. Ida is abandoned by her women and finally
surrenders to her Prince.

## The Prototypes: Tennyson's Poem and Gilbert's Play

* **Tennyson's poem [_The Princess_](../../gilbert/plays/princess/tennyson/index.htm),** which
  was the basis for Gilbert's 1870 play [_The Princess_](../../gilbert/plays/princess/princess_home.html).
* **Gilbert's 1870 play with music [_The Princess_](../../gilbert/plays/princess/princess_home.html),** from
  which _Princess Ida_ was derived.
* [**From Tennyson to Gilbert.**](tentogilbert.html) David Fidler has compared Tennyson's poem
  _The Princess_ with Gilbert's _Princess Ida_ and shown how Gilbert modified Tennyson's ideas
  and characters when making his operatic perversion of the Poet Laureate's original.
* **Comparative edition of [_The Princess_ and _Princess Ida_](../parallel-A4.zip)** prepared by
  [Marc Shepherd](/html/contributors.html#shepherd) [Zipped Word Document, 88KB] with the text of
  _The Princess_ on the left side of the page, that of _Princess Ida_ on the right. Where Gilbert
  deleted material in the transition from play to opera, the right side of the page is blank.
  Where Gilbert added material to the opera, the left side is blank. Where there is writing on
  both sides of the page, you can readily see how Gilbert modified (and, in most cases, improved
  upon) the dialogue from his earlier play.

## Discussion

  the SavoyNet distribution list. This extensive discussion provides substantial background
  information on this opera, and is a must for anyone wanting to understand it better, produce
