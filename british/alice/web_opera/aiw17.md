### The Walrus and the Carpenter

*Dance and scene. Possible dialogue during.*

#### &nbsp;
The Carpenter is sleeping,
the butter's on his face.
The vinegar and pepper
are all about the place.
Let oysters rock your cradle
and lull you into rest.
And if that will not do it,
we'll sit upon your chest.
We'll sit upon your chest, oh!
We'll sit upon your chest, oh!
The simplest way to do it
is to sit upon your chest!
