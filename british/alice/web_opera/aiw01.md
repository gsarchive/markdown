SCENE: *A Forest in Autumn. Alice asleep at foot of tree and Fairies dancing round her.*

### OPENING CHORUS.
#### &nbsp;
Sleep, Alice, sleep as we circle around thee,
Lull'd by the music of bird and of bee:
Safe in the forest, since fairies have found thee,
Here where we come to keep tryst by the tree.
Sleep, Alice, sleep, these are magical numbers,
Songs that are learned from the mount and the stream.
Ours be the task to keep watch o'er thy slumbers,
Wake, Alice, wake to the Wonderland Dream.

Wake, Alice, wake!
Wake, Alice, wake,
Alice!
Alice!
Wake to the Wonderland Dream!

Sleep, Alice, sleep, as we circle around thee,
Lull'd by the music of bird and of bee:
Safe in the forest, since fairies have found thee,
Here where we come to keep tryst by the tree.
Sleep, Alice, sleep, these are magical numbers,
Songs that are learned from the mount and the stream.
Ours be the task to keep watch o'er thy slumbers,
Wake, Alice, wake to the Wonderland Dream.
