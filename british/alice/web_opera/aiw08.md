### He is the Executioner
#### QUEEN
He is the executioner,
and thinks it very odd, he
Is asked to cut a head off
when it hasn't got a body!
#### ALL
He is the executioner,
and thinks it very odd, he
Is asked to cut a head off
when it hasn't got a body!
#### KING
Of old, my executioner
indubitably said he'd
Be sure a thing that had a head
could always be beheaded.
#### ALL
Of old his executioner
indubitably said he'd
be sure a thing that had a head
could always be beheaded.
Ah! Ah Ah! Ah Ah!

#### QUEEN
With all this idle argument,
my temper isn't suited!
If something isn't done at once,
you'll all be executed!
#### ALL
Ah! Ah Ah Ah!
All be executed! Ah!
He is the executioner
and thinks it very odd, he
Is asked to cut a head off
when it hasn't got a body.
If something isn't done at once
you'll all be executed!

*All go off at end of song.*
