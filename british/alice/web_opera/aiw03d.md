## Dialogue following No. 3

**CATERPILLAR.** That is not right.

**ALICE.** Not *quite* right, I'm afraid. Some of the words have got altered.

**CATERPILLAR.** It's wrong from beginning to end. Good day.

*CATERPILLAR and Mushroom are drawn off. Enter WHITE RABBIT.*

**RABBIT.** The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh! my fur and whiskers. She'll get me
executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets. Where can I have dropped them I wonder?

**ALICE** *(aside)* He's looking for his fan and gloves.

*She also looks for them. The RABBIT then notices her.*

**RABBIT.** Why, Mary Ann, what *are* you doing out here? Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan. Quick now!

**ALICE** *(aside)* He takes me for his housemaid. How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am. But I'd better get him his fan and gloves.
*(picks up fan and gloves and gives them to RABBIT)*

**RABBIT.** Thank you, Mary Ann, thank you. Now wait for the Duchess, she's cominng here with the baby and the cook.

*Exit RABBIT*

**ALICE.** Oh dear me! I'm Mary Ann now, and the Duchess is coming, and the baby, and the cook. Are they going to cook the baby, I wonder?

*Enter DUCHESS carrying child. COOK with a saucepan and pepper castor, and CHESHIRE CAT*

**ALICE.** Please would you tell me why your cat grins like that?

**DUCHESS.** It's a Cheshire Cat, and that's why. *(to baby)* Pig!

**ALICE.** I didn't know that Cheshire Cats always grinned; in fact I didn't know that cats *could* grin.

**DUCHESS.** They all can and most of 'em do.

**ALICE.** I don't know of any that do.

**DUCHESS.** You don't know much and that's a fact.

**COOK.** There's nothing like pepper say I. There's not half enough yet! Nor a quarter enough!

   &nbsp;
   Boil it so easily.
   Mix it so greasily,
   Stir it so sneezily,
     One, two, three.
   One for the Missis, two for the cat, and three for the baby.
{:.poem}

*The COOK peppers soup and baby alternately.*

**ALICE.** Oh, *please* mind what you're doing! Oh, there goes his *precious* nose!

**DUCHESS.** If everybody minded their own business, the world would go round a great deal faster than it does.

**ALICE.** Which would *not* be an advantage. Just think what work it would make with the day and night.
You see, the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis --

**DUCHESS.** Talking of axes, chop off her head.

**ALICE.** Twenty-four hours, I think - or is it twelve -

**DUCHESS.** Oh don't bother me. I never could abide figures.
