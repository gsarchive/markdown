### Will you Walk a Little Faster
#### &nbsp;
"Will you walk a little faster,"
said a whiting to a snail,
"There's a porpoise close behind us,
and he's treading on my tail."
See how eagerly the lobsters
and the turtles all advance,
They are waiting on the shingle,
Will you come and join the dance?

Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,
Will you join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you,
Come and join the dance?

"You can really have no notion,
how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us
with the lobsters out to sea!"
But the snail replied, "Too far,
too far," and gave a look askance,
Said he thank'd the whiting kindly,
But he would not join the dance.

Would not, could not, would not, could not,
Would not join the dance!
Would not, could not, would not, could not,
Could not join the dance!
