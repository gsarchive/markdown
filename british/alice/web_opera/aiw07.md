### King, Queen, and Knave

#### &nbsp;

King, Queen, and Knave, Here are we seen,
Dancing, Dancing, so gaily on the green.
King, Queen, and Knave, Here we are seen,
So gay today, so gay today on the green.

Dance aright in the good old way,
hearts are light on this our natal day
Dance aright in the good old way,
hearts are light on this our natal day.
Dance aright in the good old way,
hearts are light on this our natal day
Dance aright in the good old way,
hearts are light on this our natal day.

King, Queen, and Knave, Here we are seen,
Dancing, Dancing so gaily on the green,
King, Queen, and Knave, Here we are seen,
So gay today, so gay today on the green.

Tread a measure here in this glade,
King, Queen, and Alice, young man and maid,
In the woodland fair is one lot,
Gaily dance the old Gavotte.

*At end, head of CHESHIRE CAT appears in tree.*
