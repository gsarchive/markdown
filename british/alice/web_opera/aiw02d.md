## Dialogue following No. 2


**ALICE.** Oh! dear, I'm sure those are not the right words, and I'm so very tired of being all alone here.

*Comes opposite CATERPILLAR.*


**CATERPILLAR.** Who are you?
ALICE: I - I hardly know, Sir, just at present. At least I knew who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.

**CATERPILLAR.** What do you mean by that? Explain yourself.

**ALICE.** I can't explain *myself*, I'm afraid, Sir, because I'm not myself, you see.

**CATERPILLAR.** I don't see.

**ALICE.** I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly, for I can't understand it myself to begin with.

**CATERPILLAR.** You. Who are *you*?

**ALICE.** I think you ought to tell me who you are first.

**CATERPILLAR.** Why? *(ALICE tosses her head and is going off)* Come back! I've something important to say. *(ALICE returns to him)* Keep your temper.

**ALICE.** *(indignantly)* Is that all?

**CATERPILLAR.** No. So you think you're changed, do you?

**ALICE.** I'm afraid I am, Sir. I can't remember things as I used.

**CATERPILLAR.** Can't remember *what* things?

**ALICE.** Well I've tried "How doth the little busy bee", but it came out different.

**CATERPILLAR.** Try "You are old, Father William".

**ALICE.** With pleasure, Sir.
