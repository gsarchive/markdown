### You Are Old, Father William
#### &nbsp;
"You are old, Father William," the young man said,
"And your hair has become very white.
And yet you incessantly stand on your head:
Do you think, at your age, it is right?"

"In my youth," Father William replied to his son,
"I feared it might injure my brain.
But now I am perfectly sure I have none,
Why, I do it again and again!"

"You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,
and have grown most uncommonly fat.
Yet you turned a back somersault in at the door:
Pray what is the reason of that?"

"In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
"I kept all my limbs very supple
By use of this ointment, a shilling a box:
Pray allow me to sell you a couple?

Pray allow me to sell you a couple,
Pray allow me to sell you a couple,
By use of this ointment, a shilling a box:
Pray allow me to sell you a couple?"

**NOTE: Music has DS but no second set of lyrics. Sing again? Different words?**
