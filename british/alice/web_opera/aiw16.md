### The Mulberry Bush
#### &nbsp;
Here we go round the Mulberry bush,
the Mulberry bush, the Mulberry bush.
Here we go round the Mulberry bush,
On a cold and frosty morning.

This is the way we wash our hands,
wash our hands, wash our hands.
This is the way we wash our hands
On a cold and frosty morning.

This is the way we go to school,
we go to school, we go to school.
This is the way we go to school,
On a cold and frosty morning.

Here we go round the Mulberry bush,
the Mulberry bush, the Mulb'ry bush.
Here we go round the Mulberry bush,
On a cold and frosty morning.

Here we go round the Mulberry bush,
the Mulberry bush, the Mulb'ry bush.
Here we go round the Mulberry bush,
On a cold and frosty morning.
