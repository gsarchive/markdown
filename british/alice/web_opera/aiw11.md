### 'Tis the Voice of the Lobster
#### &nbsp;
'Tis the voice of the lobster
I hear him declare,
"You have baked me too brown;
I must sugar my hair!"
As a duck with its eyelids,
so he with his nose,
Trims his belt and his buttons
and turns out his toes.
When the sands are all dry,
he's gay as a lark
And talks in contemptuous
tones of the shark.
But when the tide rises
And sharks are around
His voice has a timid, timid, timid,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.

Trims his belt and his buttons

When the sands are all dry,
he's gay as a lark
And talks in contemptuous
tones of the shark.
But when the tide rises
And sharks are around
His voice has a timid, timid, timid,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.
