### Speak Roughly to your Little Boy
#### &nbsp;
Speak roughly to your little boy
and beat him when he sneezes,
For he can thoroughly enjoy
the pepper when he pleases.

Bow, wow, wow, mew, mew mew,
The pepper when he pleases.
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
The pepper when he pleases.

Bow, wow, wow, mew, mew mew,
The pepper when he pleases.
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
The pepper when he pleases.

**NOTE: Music has DS but no second set of lyrics. Repeated?**
