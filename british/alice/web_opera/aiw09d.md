## Dialogue following No. 9


**MOCK.** You may not have lived under the sea.

**ALICE.** I haven't.

**MOCK.** And perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster?

**ALICE.** I have tasted-- *(checks herself)* No never!

**MOCK.** So you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is?

**ALICE.** No indeed! What sort of dance is it?

**GRYPHON.** Why, you first form into a line along the sea-shore -

**MOCK.** Two lines! Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then when you've cleared
all the jelly-fish out of the way -

**GRYPHON.** *That* generally takes some time!

**MOCK.** You advance twice -

**GRYPHON.** Each with a lobster for a partner -

**MOCK.** Of course, advance twice, set to partners!

**GRYPHON.** Change lobsters and retire in same order.

**MOCK.** Then you throw the--

**GRYPHON.** The Lobsters! *(with a shout and bound into the air)*

**MOCK.** As far out to sea as you can.

**GRYPHON.** Swim after them!

**MOCK.** Turn a somersault in the sea! *(capering about)*

**MOCK.** Back to ladnd again and that's all the first figure.

*The two creatures who have been jumping about like mad things, now sit down again and look at ALICE.*

**ALICE.** It must be a very pretty dance!

**MOCK.** Would you like to see a bit more of it?

**ALICE.** Very much indeed!

**MOCK** *(to GRYPHON).* Come let's try the first figure. We can do it without lobsters you know. You sing.
