### Alice's Health
#### &nbsp;
Alice's health, Long life and wealth,
Never a monarch so mighty was seen.
Gaily fill up, Beaker and cup,
Drink to our Alice, our Alice, our Queen!
Alice's health, Alice's health, Alice's health.
Alice's health, Long life and wealth,
Never a monarch so mighty was seen.
Gaily fill up, Beaker and cup,
Drink to our Alice, our Alice, our Queen!

Wake, Alice, wake now; no longer a rover,
Fast fade the Wonderland visions away!
Wake at the elves' call, the dream play is over,
Wake, Alice, wake, to the world of today!
Wake at the elves' call, the dream play is over,
Wake, Alice, wake, to the world of today!
Wake at the elves' call, the dream play is over,
Wake, Alice, wake, to the world of today!

*Gauzes down, and stage dark*
