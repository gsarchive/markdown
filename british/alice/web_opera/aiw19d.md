## Dialogue following No. 19

*Enter RED KING and ALICE*


**RED KING.** I've sent them all. I couldn't send all the horses, you know, because
they're wanted; and I haven't sent the two messengers. They're both gone to the
town. Just look along the road and tell me if you see either of them.

**ALICE.** I see nobody on the road.

**RED KING.** I only wish I had such eyes. To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance
too, why it is as much as I can do to see real people.

**ALICE** *(looking off).* I see somebody now; but what curious attitudes!

**RED KING.** Not at all; He's an Anglo-Saxon messenger and those are Anglo-Saxon
attitudes. *(Enter Messenger)* His name is Hare, and the other is Hatter. I
must have two, you know; one to come and one to go.

**ALICE.** I beg your pardon!

**RED KING.** It isn't respectable to beg.

**ALICE.** I only meant I didn't understand.

**RED KING.** Didn't I tell you I must have two; one to fetch and one to carry. *(to Messenger)*
What's the matter? you alarm me - I feel faint! Give me a ham
sandwich. *(Messenger hands one out of bag; KING eats it.)* Another sandwich.

**HARE.** There's nothing but hay left now.

**RED KING.** Hay then. *(Hay is handed him and he munches it.)* *(to ALICE)* There's nothing
like eating hay when you're faint. *(to Messenger)* Who did you pass on the road?

**HARE.** Nobody!

**RED KING.** Quite right, this lady saw him too. So of course nobody walks slower than you.

**HARE.** I do my best. I'm sure nobody walks faster than I do.

**RED KING.** He can't do that, or he'd have been here first. However, tell us what's going to happen.

**HARE.** I'll whisper it. *(HARE makes a trumpet of his hands, and puts them to KING's ear, then shouts loudly)* They're at it again.

**RED KING** *(jumps).* Do you call *that* a whisper? If you do such a thing again, I'll have
you buttered. It went through and through my head like an earthquake.

**ALICE.** Who are at it again?

**RED KING.** Why the Lion and the Unicorn fighting for the Crown, and the best of the joke
is that it's *my* crown all the time! Here they come!

*Enter LION and UNICORN fighting*

**UNICORN** *(to KING).* I had the best of it that time.

**RED KING.** A little, a little!

**UNICORN.** Come fetch out the plum cake, old man, none of your brown bread for
me. *(HARE offers cake to LION, looking at KING)* What a fight we must have
for the crown now!

*KING trembles*

**LION.** I should win easy.

**UNICORN.** I'm not so sure of that.

**LION.** Why I beat you all round the town, you know. Didn't I?

**ALL.** Yes! Yes!
