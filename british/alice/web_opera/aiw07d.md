## Dialogue following No. 7

**CAT** *(to ALICE).* How do you like the Queen?

**ALICE.** Not at all. She's extremely - *(QUEEN comes beside her)* polite. *(QUEEN smiles and passes on)*

**KING.** Who *are* you talking to?

**ALICE.** It's a friend of mine, a Cheshire Cat.

**KING.** A Cheshire Cat?

**ALICE.** Allow me to introduce it.

**KING.** I don't like the look of it at all. However it may kiss my hand if it likes.

**CAT.** I'd rather not.

**KING.** Don't be impertinent, and don't look at me like that. *(gets behind QUEEN)*

**ALICE.** A cat may look at a King.

**KING.** Well it must be removed. *(to QUEEN)* My dear, I wish you would have this cat removed.

**QUEEN.** Off with his head.

**KING.** Hi! Executioner.

**KNAVE.** Here he is.
*Enter EXECUTIONER*

**KING.** Off with that cat's head.

**EXECUTIONER.** Can't be done.

**QUEEN.** What!

**EXECUTIONER.** You can't cut a head off unless there's a body to cut it off from.
I never had to do such a thing before and I'm not going to begin at my time of life.
