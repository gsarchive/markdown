## Dialogue following No. 22

*ALICE and QUEENS take up position. Joint and Pudding set before them.*

**RED QUEEN.** We always miss the soup and fish. Put on the joint. *(ALICE takes knife and fork,
and hesitates)* You look a little shy, let me introduce you to that leg of mutton. Alice -
mutton! mutton - Alice! *(Leg of mutton gets up and bows)*

**ALICE.** May I give you a slice?

**RED QUEEN.** Certainly not! It isn't etiquette to cut anyone you've beeen introduced to. Remove the joint!

*Mutton taken off by head and legs. Large plum-pudding brought on.*

**ALICE.** I won't be introduced to the pudding please, or we shall get no dinner at all! May I give you some?

**RED QUEEN** *(sulkily, growling).* Pudding - Alice! Alice - pudding! Remove the pudding!

*They are taking it out*

**ALICE.** Waiter, bring back the pudding! *(It is brought back, Alice cuts a slice and hands it to QUEEN.)* Let me help you!

**PUDDING.** What impertinence! I wonder how you'd like it if I were to cut a slice out of *you*, you creature!

**RED QUEEN.** Now we'll drink your health. Queen Alice's health!

**ALL.** Queen Alice's health!
