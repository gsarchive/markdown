## Dialogue following No. 16


**DUM.** That's enough for one dance!

*Both stop suddenly out of breath, music also stops suddenly and they drop her hands.*

**ALICE** *(aside).* It would never do to say "How d'ye do" *now*; we seem to have got beyond that somehow. *(aloud)* I hope you're not much tired!

**DUM.** Nohow! And thank you very much for asking.

**DEE.** Contrariwise! So *much* obliged! Can you repeat us some poetry?

**ALICE** *(doubtfully).* Perhaps I could!

**DUM.** Nohow!

**DEE.** Contrariwise! Repeat "The Walrus and the Carpenter"?

**ALICE.** I'm afraid I don't know it!

**DUM.** Then we'll tell it you.

*Scene opens and discloses sea-shore, and WALRUS and CARPENTER*
