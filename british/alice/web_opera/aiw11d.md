## Dialogue following No. 11


**GRYPHON.** It is time for the trial.

**ALICE.** What trial.

**MOCK.** The trial of the Knave of Hearts.

*Trumpets and March music. Enter KING and QUEEN of Hearts, Court Cards, &c. WHITE RABBIT attired as Herald. KNAVE in chains guarded by soldiers.*

**KING.** Herald, read the accusation.

*WHITE RABBIT blows three blasts on trumpet, unrolls a scroll, and reads.*

**RABBIT.**
   The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts
     All on a summer day,
   The knave of Hearts he stole those tarts
     And took them quite away.
{:.poem}

**KING.** Call the first witness.

**RABBIT** *(blows trumpet).* First witness.

*Enter HATTER with teacup, and bread and butter. Also MARCH HARE and DORMOUSE arm in arm.*

**HATTER.** I beg your pardon, your Majesty, for bringing these in, but I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.

**KING.** You ought to have finished. When did you begin?

**HATTER.** Fourteenth of March I *think* it was.

**KING.** Take off your hat.

**HATTER.** It isn't mine.

**KING.** Stolen!

**HATTER.** I keep them to sell. I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.

*QUEEN puts on spectacles and glares at him and he fidgets.*

**KING.** Give your evidence and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot.

*HATTER fidgets and bites a piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter.*

**QUEEN.** Bring me the list of singers at the last concert.

*HATTER trembles so that he shakes his shoes off.*

**KING.** Give your evidence or I'll have you executed whether you're nervous or not.

**HATTER.** I'm a poor man, your Majesty, and I hadn't begun my tea - not above a week or so, and what with the bread and butter getting so thin, and the twinkling of the tea -

**KING.** The twinkling of the *what*?

**HATTER.** It *began* with the tea.

**KING.** Of course twinking *[sic]* begins with a T. Do you take me for a dunce? Go on.

**HATTER.** I'm a poor man and most things twinkled after that - only the March Hare said -

**HARE.** I didn't!

**HATTER.** You did!

**HARE.** I deny it!

**KING.** He denies it, leave out that part!

**HATTER.** Well at any rate the Dormouse said -

**DORMOUSE.** I didn't.

**HATTER.** You did!

**DORMOUSE.** I deny it!

**HATTER.** And after that I cut some more bread and butter.

**KING.** But *what* did the Dormouse say?

**HATTER.** That I can't remember.

**KING.** You must remember or I'll have you executed!

*HATTER drops teacup, and bread and butter, and goes on his knees*

**HATTER.** I'm a poor man, your Majesty.

**KING.** You're a very poor speaker! *(applause in Court)* and if that's all you know about it you may stand down.

**HATTER.** I can't go no lower. I'm on the floor as it is.

**KING.** Then you may *sit* down!

**HATTER.** I'd rather finish my tea.

**KING.** You may go -- *(HATTER rushes out)*

**QUEEN.** And just take his head off outside?

**KING.** Call the next witness!

*Enter the Duchess's COOK with pepper pot - one or two sneezes heard near her*

**KING.** Be good enough to take the time from me. Now all together. *(All sneeze. To COOK)* Give your evidence.

**COOK.** Shan't!

**KING.** What are these tarts made of?

**COOK.** Pepper mostly.

**DORMOUSE.** Treacle!

**QUEEN.** Collar that Dormouse! Behead that Dormpise! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!

*COOK stands back.*

**KING.** Next witness?

**RABBIT** *(blows trumpet).* Alice!

**KING.** What do you know about this business?

**ALICE.** Nothing!

**KING.** Nothing *whatever*?

**ALICE.** Nothing whatever!

**KING.** That's very important! In that case consider your verdict.

**QUEEN.** No no, sentence first, verdict afterwards.

**ALICE.** Stuff and nonsense.

**QUEEN.** Hold your tongue.

**ALICE.** I won't.

**QUEEN.** Off with her head.

**ALICE.** Who cares for you! My verdict is "Not Guilty, but the Knave mustn't steal the tarts again."

**ALL.** Not guilty! Hurrah!
