## Dialogue following No. 1

*Fairies troop off at each side, the Chorus dying softly away in the distance. Scene changes to
Wonderland, Garden set. The CATERPILLAR discovered smoking on gigantic mushroom at side. ALICE
wakes up, and goes up and down stage in great bewilderment. The WHITE RABBIT crosses the stage hurriedly.*

**RABBIT.** Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh, won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!

**ALICE.** If you please, Sir - *(RABBIT starts and exit dropping white kid gloves and fan.)* Dear!
Dear! How queer everything is to-day. And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if
I've been changed in the night. Let me think, was I the same when I got up this morning. But if
I'm not the same, who am I? Ah! that's the puzzle. I'll try if I know all the things I used to
know. Let me see: Four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times
seven - Oh dear, I shall never get to twenty at that rate. I'll try "How doth the little busy bee."
