### Humpty Dumpty's Fallen Down
#### &nbsp;
Humpty Dumpty's fallen down,
Humpty Dumpty, Humpty Dumpty;
Humpty Dumpty's cracked his crown,
Humpty Dumpty.
But the king keeps his promise,
The king keeps his promise, his promise,
The king keeps his promise, though horses and men
Can't put Humpty Dumpty together again
Though all the king's horses and king's men may race,
'Tis clear they can never restore to his place,
Humpty Dumpty, Humpty Dumpty.
Humpty, Humpty Dumpty Dumpty;
Humpty Dumpty's fallen down,
Humpty Dumpty's cracked his crown,
Humpty Dumpty, Humpty Dumpty;
Humpty Dumpty's fallen down,
Humpty Dumpty's cracked his crown.

*As she finishes, HUMPTY DUMPTY seats himself on the wall at back.*
