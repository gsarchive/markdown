### Cheshire Puss, my thanks to thee

#### ALICE.
Cheshire Pussy, thanks to thee,
for the things you've told to me.
You've such information rare,
No cat with you can compare
How I wish my Dinah too
could converse as well as you,
for, your answers come so pat;
You're a wondrous Cheshire Cat.

#### BOTH.
For your/my answers come so pat,
You're/I'm a wondrous Cheshire Cat.
For your/my answers come so pat,
You're/I'm a wondrous Cheshire Cat.

#### CAT.

Alice, you're extremely kind,
Thus to praise my active mind,
Let your Dinah to me come
at a reasonable sum.
I will teach her all I know,
Make her manners *'comme il faut'*.
Till folks marvel what I'm at,
I'm a wondrous Cheshire Cat.

#### BOTH.

Till folks marvel what you're/I'm at,
You're/I'm a wondrous Cheshire Cat.
Till folks marvel what you're/I'm at,
You're/I'm a wondrous Cheshire Cat.

*Dance and exeunt.*
