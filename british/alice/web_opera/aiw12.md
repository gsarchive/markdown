### "Not Guilty" I declare
#### ALICE
"Not guilty" I declare,
But let the Knave take care
In future not to steal
the tempting tarts
#### KING
Not guilty, then I fear
You cannot now, my dear,
Behead for stealing
that bad Knave of Hearts.
#### QUEEN
Not guilty! Oh, it's shocking,
Miss Alice must be mocking,
Don't tell me that the tarts themselves
ran off, and left the shelf!
#### ALICE
Yes, that's the view I've taken,
If your nerves, my dear, are shaken,
I would venture to advise you
just to execute yourself.
#### CHILDREN
Yes, that's the view we've taken,
And if your nerves are shaken,
We would venture to advise you
just to execute yourself.
Yes, that's the view we've taken,
If your nerves, my dear, are shaken,
We would venture to advise you
just to execute yourself.
Yes, execute yourself.

#### ALL
It's very hard upon the Queen of Hearts
Who vowed the Knave stole tarts;
To find that Knave by verdict of one friend
"Not guilty" in the end.
Not guilty, not guilty, not guilty in the end.
Not guilty, not guilty, not guilty in the end.
It's very hard upon the Queen of Hearts
Who vowed the Knave stole tarts;
To find that Knave by verdict of one friend
"Not guilty" in the end.

Not guilty we declare.
But let the Knave take care,
In future from the tarts to keep his hand.
Not guilty! now we know
Why these strange things are so
And why our Alice came to Wonderland,
Wonderland, Why Alice came to Wonderland.
