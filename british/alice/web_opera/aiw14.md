### Jabberwocky

#### CHORUS
'Twas brillig and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe,
All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe!
Outgrabe!

#### QUEEN
Beware the Jabberwock, my son,
The jaws that bite, the claws that scratch!
Beware the jujube bird, and shun
the frumious Bandersnatch!

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
long time the mascome foe he sought.
So rested he by the tum tum tree
and stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock with eyes of flame
Came whiffling through the tulgry wood
and burbled as he came.

One, two, one, two, and thro' and thro'
The vorpal blade went snickersnack.
He left it dead and with its head
he went golumping back.

And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy.
O frabgous day, Calloh, Callay!
He chortled in his joy.

#### CHORUS
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe,
All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe,
outgrabe.

*All rush off. ALICE alone.*
