## Dialogue following No. 18


**ALICE.** Why, there he is I declare! And how exactly like an egg he is!

**HUMPTY.** It's very provoking to be called an egg! Very!

**ALICE.** I said you *looked* like an egg, sir! And some eggs are very pretty you know.

**HUMPTY.** Some people have no more sense than a baby! What's your name and business?

**ALICE.** My name is Alice!

**HUMPTY.** It's a stupid name, what does it mean?

**ALICE.** *Must* a name mean something?

**HUMPTY.** Of course it must! *my* name means the shape I am, and a very handsome shape it is
too! With a name like yours you might be any shape almost.

**ALICE.** Why do you sit out here all alone?

**HUMPTY.** Why, because there's nobody with me! Did you think I didn't know the answer to
that? Ask another.

**ALICE.** Don't you think you'd be safer down on the ground?

**HUMPTY.** What tremendously easy riddles you ask! Of course I don't think so! Why if I ever *did*
fall - which there's no chance of - the King has promised me, with his very own mouth -

**ALICE.** To send all his horses and all his men.

**HUMPTY.** Now I declare that's too bad, you've been listening at doors, and behind trees, and
down chimneys, or you couldn't have known it.

**ALICE.** I haven't indeed! It's in a book.

**HUMPTY.** Ah well! They may write such things in a book. That's what you call a History of
England that is! Now take a good look at me. I'm one who has spoken to a king, *I* am;
mayhap you'll never see such another; and to show I'm not proud, you may shake hands with me.

*He shakes hands with ALICE*

**ALICE.** What a beautiful belt you've got on!

**HUMPTY** *(in a deep growl).* It is a *most provoking thing* when a person does not know a cravat
from a belt! It's a cravat, child, and the White King and Queen gave it to me as an un-birthday present!

**ALICE.** I beg your pardon?

**HUMPTY.** I'm not offended!

**ALICE.** I mean, what *is* an un-birthday present?

**HUMPTY.** A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.

**ALICE.** I like birthday presents best!

**HUMPTY.** You don't know what you're talking about! How many days are there in a year?

**ALICE.** Three hundred and sixty-five.

**HUMPTY.** And how many birthdays have you?

**ALICE.** One.

**HUMPTY.** And if you take one from 365, what remains?

**ALICE.** 364, of course.

**HUMPTY.** Well, that shows that there are 364 days when you might get un-birthday present.s

**ALICE.** Certainly.

**HUMPTY.** And only one for birthday presents. That's all, good-bye.

**ALICE.** Good-bye till we meet again.

**HUMPTY.** I shouldn't know you again if we *did* meet, you're so exactly like other people.

**ALICE.** The face is what one generally goes by.

**HUMPTY.** That's just what I complain of. Your face is the same asa everybody has - the two
eyes - so *(marking the places in the air with his thumb)*, nose in the middle, mouth
under. It's always the same. Now if you had two eyes on the same side of the nose for
instance - or the mouth at the top - that would be *some* help.

**ALICE.** It wouldn't look nice.

**HUMPTY.** Wait till you've tried.

**ALICE.** Good-bye. *(going off)* Of all the unsatisfactory people I ever met!

*Starts and runs off - for HUMPTY falls with a fearful crash off the wall. Enter all the king's horses and all the king's men.*
