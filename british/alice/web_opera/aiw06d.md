## Dialogue following No. 6

*Enter Two, Five, and Seven of Clubs, then KING, QUEEN, and KNAVE of Hearts and other
Cards; also ALICE - Procession goes round the stage. Two, Five, and Seven lie down at sides.*


**QUEEN** *(to KNAVE).* Who is this? *(KNAVE only bows)* Idiot! *(to ALICE)* What's your name, child?

**ALICE.** My name is Alice, so please your majesty. *(aside)* Why they're only a
pack of cards; I needn't be afraid of them.

**QUEEN** *(pointing to Two, Five, and Seven).* And who are *these*?

**ALICE.** How should *I* know? It's no business of mine.

**QUEEN** *(glares at ALICE and then shouts).* Off with her head! off--

**KING.** Consider, my dear; she is only a child.

**QUEEN** *(to KNAVE).* Turn them over. *(Two, Five, and Seven get up and bow rapidly to everyone)*
Leave off that, you make me giddy. Off with their heads!

**ALICE.** You shan't be beheaded. *(shows them off stage)*

**RABBIT** *(to ALICE).* It's - it's a very fine day.

**ALICE.** Very! where's the Duchess?

**RABBIT.** Hush! Hush! She's under sentence of execution.

**ALICE.** What for?

**RABBIT.** Did you say what a pity?

**ALICE.** No I didn't. I don't think it at all a pity - I said what for?

**RABBIT.** She boxed the Queen's ears.

**ALICE.** Oh what fun!

**RABBIT.** Oh hush, the Queen will hear you.

**QUEEN.** Are their heads off?

**KNAVE.** Their heads are off, so please your Majesty.

**QUEEN.** Get to your places!
*KING gives ALICE his hand - KNAVE with QUEEN. Grand Gavotte of Court Cards.*
