The text here has been graciously made available by [Charlie Lovett](https://charlielovett.com/) via his
book, "Alice on Stage". These pages approximately follow the text from the 1886 publication. Song lyrics
are from the [1896 music score](https://imslp.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_%28Slaughter%2C_Walter%29) as
published on IMSLP. Typos and other corrections can be directed to the Archive's curators.
