## Dialogue following No. 4

**DUCHESS** *(to COOK)* Off with you. *(exit COOK)* Here, catch! *(throws baby off stage)* I'm going to the Queen.

*exeunt DUCHESS, CAT, and RABBIT*

**ALICE.** I wonder what I'm going to do. I hope the cook caught the baby.

*The head of CHESHIRE CAT appears in tree.*

**ALICE.** Cheshire Puss. Would you tell me please which way I ought to go from here?

**CAT.** That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.

**ALICE.** I don't much care where.

**CAT.** Then it doesn't matter which way you go.

**ALICE.** So long as I get *somewhere*.

**CAT.** Oh you're sure to do that, if you only walk long enough.

**ALICE.** What sort of people live about here?

**CAT.** In one direction lives a Hatter, and in the other a March Hare. Visit either you like - they're both mad.

**ALICE.** But I don't want to go among mad people.

**CAT.** Oh you can't help that. We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.

**ALICE.** How do you know I'm mad?

**CAT.** You must be, or you wouldn't have come here.

**ALICE.** And how do you know that you're mad?

**CAT.** To begin with, a dog's not mad. You grant that?

**ALICE.** I suppose so.

**CAT.** Well then. You see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.
Now I grow when I'm pleased and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.

**ALICE.** I call it *purring* not growling.

**CAT.** Call it what you like; and say "thank you for the information".
