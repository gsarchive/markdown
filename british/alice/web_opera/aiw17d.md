## Dialogue following No. 17


**ALICE.** I like the Walrus best, because you see he was a *little* sorry for the poor oysters.

**DEE.** He ate more than the carpenter though. You see he held his handkerchief in front so that the carpenter couldn't count how many he took. Contrariwise!

**ALICE.** That was mean, then I like the Carpenter best - if he didn't eat so many as the Walrus.

**DUM.** But he ate as many as he could get.

**ALICE** *(lights rather down).* It's getting dark! Do you think it's going to rain?

*TwEEDLEDUM spreads a large umbrella over himself and brother.*

**DUM.** No! I don't think it is, at least, not under *here*! Nohow!

**ALICE.** But it may outside!

**DEE.** It may if it chooses, we've no objection. Contrariwise.

**ALICE.** Selfish things! I shall say good-bye.

*Turns to go when TWEEDLEDUM rushes from under umbrella and seizes her by the wrist*

**DUM** *(in a rage - pointing to small white rattle under tree).* Do you see *that*?

**ALICE.** It's only a rattle - not a rattle-*snake*, you know - only an old rattle, quite old and broken.

**DUM** *(dancing about in a rage, tearing his hair, &c).* I knew it was, it's spoilt of course.

**ALICE.** You needn't be so angry about an old rattle.

**DUM.** But it isn't old! It's new, I tell you! I bought it yesterday. *(screaming)* My nice new rattle!

*During this TWEEDLEDEE tries to fold himself up in the umbrella with only his head out, in a fright*

**DUM** *(to DEE).* Of course you agree to have a battle!

**DEE** *(sulkily, crawling out of umbrella)* I suppose so; only *she* must help us to dress up, you know.

*They run off at opposite sides and bring on bolsters, blankets, hearthrugs, and coalscuttles*

**DUM.** I hope you're a good hand at pinning and tying strings. Every one of
these things has got to go on somehow or other!

*They bustle about and dress up, ALICE helping them.*

**ALICE** *(aside).* Really they 'll be more like bundles of old clothes by the time they're ready.

**DEE.** Now for the bolster to keep my head from being cut off! *(ALICE ties it on)* You
know it's one of the most serious things that can possiblyy happen to one in a battle - to get one's head cut off!

**DEE** *(coming up to her to have a coalscuttle tied on).* Do I look very pale?

**ALICE.** Well - yes - a *little*.

**DUM.** I'm very brave generally, only to-day I happen to have a headache!

**DEE.** And I've got a toothache, I'm far worse than you!

**ALICE.** Then you'd better not fight to-day!

**DUM.** We *must* have a bit of a fight, but I don't care about going on long! What's the time now?

**DEE.** Half past four.

**DUM.** Let's fight till six and then have dinner!

**DEE.** Very well, and *she* can watch us, only you'd better not come *very* close,
I generally hit everything I can see when I get really excited.

**DUM.** And *I* hit everything within reach whether I see it or not!

**ALICE** *(laughing).* You must hit the trees pretty often I should think.

**DUM.** I don't suppose there'll be a tree left standing for ver so far round by the time we've finished.

**ALICE.** And all about a rattle.

**DUM.** I shouldn't have minded it so much if it hadn't been a new one.

**ALICE** *(aside).* I wish the monstrous crow would come.

**DUM** *(to his brother).* There's only one sword *(takes up wooden toy sword)* but
you can have the umbrella. It's quite as sharp. *(Stage darker)* Only we must begin quick. It's getting as dark as it can.

*They fence up to each other*

**DEE.** And darker.

**ALICE.** What a thick black cloud that is, and how fast it comes! why I do believe it's got wings.

**DUM.** It's the crow!

*Both rush off frantically. Stage light again, WHITE QUEEN's shawl flies across to ALICE who catches it*


**ALICE.** Dear me. Here's somebody's shawl being blown away.

*Enter WHITE QUEEN and ALICE puts the shawl on.*

**ALICE.** Am I addressing the White Queen?

**WHITE QUEEN.** Well yes; if you call that a-dressing. It isn't my notion of the thing at all.

**ALICE.** If your Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I'll do it as well as I can.

**WHITE QUEEN.** But I don't want it done at all, I've been a-dressing myself for the last two hours.

**ALICE** *(aside).* Every single thing's crooked and she's all over pins. *(aloud)* May I put your shawl straight for you?

**WHITE QUEEN.** I don't know what's the matter with it. It's out of temper, I think.
I've pinned it here and pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it.

**ALICE** *(putting the QUEEN to rights).* Come, you look rather better now, but really you should have a lady's-maid.

**WHITE QUEEN.** I'm sure I'll take you with pleasure. Two-pence a week and jam every other day.

**ALICE** *(laughing).* I don't want you to hire *me*, and I don't care for jam.

**WHITE QUEEN.** It's very good jam.

**ALICE.** Well I don't want any *to-day* at any rate.

**WHITE QUEEN.** You couldn't have it if you *did* want it. The rule is jam to-morrow
and jam yesterday, but never jam to-day.

**ALICE.** It must sometimes come to jam to-day.

**WHITE QUEEN.** No it can't! It's jam every *other* day, and to-day isn't any *other* day, you know.

**ALICE.** I don't understand you! It's dreadfully confusing!

**WHITE QUEEN.** That's the effect of living backwards! It always makes me a little giddy at first.

**ALICE.** Living backwards - I never heard of such a thing!

**WHITE QUEEN.** But there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both ways.

**ALICE.** I'm sure *mine* works only one way, I can't remember things before they happen!

**WHITE QUEEN.** It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards. Try the other way,
sing "Humpty Dumpty" and you'll see what will happen - ta-ta!

*Exit WHITE QUEEN*


**ALICE.** Sing "Humpy Dumpty"? I wonder what will happen!
