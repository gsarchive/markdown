## Dialogue following No. 14


**ALICE.** Dear me I wish they had stayed! *(To LILY)* Oh Tiger-Lily, I wish you could talk?

**LILY.** We *can* talk, when there's anybody worth talking to!

**ALICE** *(almost in a whisper).* And can *all* the flowers talk?

**LILY.** As well as *you* can and a great deal louder.

**ROSE.** It isn't manners for us to begin, you know, and really was wondering when
you'd speak. <!-- Now let me see... Yes, yes! Don't speak until you're spoken to! --> Said
I to myself, "her face has got some sense in it, though it's not a clever one." Still
you're the right colour and that goes a long way.

**LILY.** I don't care about the colour! If only her petals curled up a little more she'd be all right!

**ALICE.** Aren't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here with nobody to take care of you?

**ROSE.** There's a tree, what else is it good for? <!-- When she found that he was fickle was her great oak tree -->

**ALICE.** But what could it do if any danger came?

**ROSE.** It could bark. It says "Bough-wough", and that's why its branches are called boughs.

**ALICE.** How is it that you can talk so nicely? I've been in many gardens before but none of the flowers could talk!

**LILY.** Put your hand down and feel the ground, then you'll know why!

**ALICE** *(feeling the ground).* It's very hard, but I don't see what that has to do with it.

**LILY.** In most gardens they make the beds too soft, so that the flowers are always asleep.

**ALICE.** I never thought of that before! Are there any more people in the garden besides me?

**ROSE.** There's one other flower in the garden that can move about like you. I wonder how you do it, but she's more bushy than you are.

**ALICE.** Is she like me? *(aside)* There's another little girl in the garden somewhere.

**ROSE.** Well she has the same awkward shape as you, but she's redder, and her petals are shorter, I think.

**LILY.** Her petals are done up close, almost like a Dahlia - not tumbled about anyhow like yours!

**ALICE.** Does she ever come out here?

**ROSE.** I daresay you'll see her soon. She's one of the thorny kind!

**ALICE.** Where does she wear the thorns?

**ROSE.** Why all round her head of course! I was wondering *you* hadn't got
some too. I thought it was the regular rule!

**LILY.** She's coming, I can hear her footstep thump, thump, along the gravel walk.

*Enter RED QUEEN*


**RED QUEEN.** Where do you come from? And where are you going? Look up, speak nicely,
and don't twiddle your fingers all the time.

**ALICE.** I've lost my way.

**RED QUEEN.** I don't know what you mean by *your* way - all the ways about here
belong to me - but why did you come here at all? Curtsey while you're thinking what to say, it saves time.

**ALICE.** Indeed - I'll try it when I go home, the next time I'm a little late for dinner.

**RED QUEEN.** It's time for you to answer now, open your mouth a *little* wider
when you speak, and always say "Your Majesty".

**ALICE.** I wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty.

**RED QUEEN** *(patting ALICE's head).* That's right, though when you say "garden", *I've* seen
gardens compared with which, this would be a wilderness.

**ALICE.** And I thought I'd try to find my way to the top of that hill.

**RED QUEEN.** When you say "hill", *I* could show you hills in comparison with which you would call that a valley.

**ALICE.** No I shouldn't, a hill *can't* be a valley you know. That would be nonsense.

**RED QUEEN** *(shaking her head).* You may call it nonsense, but *I've* heard nonsense
compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary. Would you like to play Chess?

**ALICE** *(curtseying).* Oh yes, your Majesty. What fun it would be. How I wish I was
one of you. I wouldn't mind being a pawn if only I might join - though of course I should *like* to be a Queen best.

**RED QUEEN.** That's easily managed. You can be the White Queen's Pawn, if you like,
as Lily's too young to play, and you're in the second square to begin with; when you
get to the eighth square you'll be a Queen, come along! You'll see Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

*Takes ALICE by the hand and both run off. Enter TWEEDLEDUM and TWEEDLEDEE solemnly, and take up position side by side, umbrella behind.*
