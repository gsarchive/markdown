### When the Wind is in the East
#### &nbsp;
When the wind is in the East,
On newlaid eggs I always feast!
When the wind is in the West,
I steal them from the Dodo's nest.
When the wind is in the South,
I place a dozen in my mouth!
When the wind is in the North,
On wintry nights I sally forth!

All the animals in the Ark,
Come to life when the house is dark,
Cocks and hens, and the owl and crow,
Flap their wings and away they go!
Up the passage and down the stairs,
Over tables and under chairs,
Pigs and puppies and polar bears,
They follow their leader round.

Up the middle and down again,
Follow my leader round
Out in the snow and hail and rain,
Follow my leader round.
Shut in a wooden ark all day,
Night is the only time to play,
Over the hills and far away,
Follow my leader round!

Up the middle and down again,
Follow my leader round
Out in the snow and hail and rain,
Follow my leader round.
Shut in a wooden ark all day,
Night is the only time to play,
Over the hills and far away,
Follow my leader round!
