## Dialogue following No. 13

*WHITE KING and QUEEN on floor. Enter ALICE.*

**ALICE.** Why the chessmen are walking about!

**WHITE QUEEN.** My Precious Lily! My Imperial kitten! *tries to get up*

**WHITE KING** *(sitting up and rubbing his nose).* Imperial fiddlestick.

*ALICE lifts WHITE QUEEN up to a standing position; also the pawn*

**WHITE QUEEN** *(to KING).* Mind the Volcano!

**WHITE KING.** What Volcano?

**WHITE QUEEN.** It blew me up onto my legs. Mind you get up in the regular way, don't get blown up!
<!-- I think Paramount would agree that kings ought not to be blown up. -->

**ALICE** *(lifting the KING up).* Why you'll be hours and hours getting up at that rate. *(the KING is struggling to rise)* I'd far better help you! Hadn't I? *(helps the KING up hastily and dusts him. He makes faces.)* Oh please don't make such faces, my dear! You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you. And don't keep your mouth so wide open! All the dust will get into it! There, now I think you're tidy. *(Holds the KING upright; the moment she lets him go he falls flat on his back.)* Oh! he's fainted.

**WHITE KING** *(to QUEEN).* I assure you, my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!

**WHITE QUEEN.** You haven't got any whiskers?

**WHITE KING.** The horror of that moment I shall never, *never* forget!

**WHITE QUEEN.** You will though, if you don't make a memorandum of it?

*KING gets up, takes out memorandum book, and tries to write. ALICE takes hold of his hand and pencil and helps him.*

**WHITE KING.** My dear, I really must get a thinner pencil! I can't manage this one a bit - it writes all manner of things I don't intend.

**WHITE QUEEN** *(taking it).* What manner of things? *That's* not a memorandum of your feelings! *(to ALICE)* Here, you read it, or sing it?

**ALICE.** Dear me! It's all in some language I don't know.

**WHITE QUEEN** *(to WHITE KNIGHT).* Then you read it!
