### Beautiful Soup
#### &nbsp;
Beautiful soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen.
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the ev'ning, beautiful soup.
Beautiful soup.
Beautiful soup.

Soup of the ev'ning,
Beautiful beautiful soup.

Beautiful soup, who cares for fish
Game or any other dish.
Who would not give all else for two
Pen'orth only of beautiful soup.
Beautiful soup.
Beautiful soup.

Soup of the ev'ning,
Beautiful beautiful soup.
