### Arranged in due order
### &nbsp;
Here ranged in due order of battle we stand,
With Red King and White King and Queens on each hand;
The Bishops move sideways to aid in the fight,
And see how erratic the course of the Knight;
The Pawns are full privates and both wings to guard,
The four sturdy Castles keep due watch and ward.
The Pawns are full privates and both wings to guard,
The four sturdy Castles keep due watch and ward.

And see how erratic the course of the Knight!

*Dance; at the end of which one of the white pawns falls down, and the
WHITE QUEEN rushes to her to pick her up, knocking the WHITE KING down
in her haste.*
