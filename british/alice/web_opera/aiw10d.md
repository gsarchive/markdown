## Dialogue following No. 10


**ALICE.** Thank you! It's a very interesting dance; and I do so like that curious song about the whiting.

**MOCK.** Oh, as to the whiting - you've seen them of course?

**ALICE.** Yes, I've often seen them at dinn--

**MOCK.** I don't know where Dinn may be, but if you've seen them so often of course you know what they're like.

**ALICE.** I believe so, they have their tails in their mouths, and they're all over crumbs.

**MOCK.** You're wrong about the crumbs, crumbs would all wash off in the sea, but they *have* their tails in their mouths.

**GRYPHON.** The reason is they would go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got
thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast
in their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again.

**ALICE.** Thank you, it's very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.

**GRYPHON.** Do you know why it's called a whiting?

**ALICE.** I never thought about it.

**GRYPHON.** It does the boots and shoes. *(solemnly)*

**ALICE.** *Does* the boots and shoes?

**GRYPHON.** Why, what are *your* shoes done with - I mean what makes them so shiny?

**ALICE.** They're done with *blacking*, I believe.

**GRYPHON.** Boots and shoes under the sea are done with *whiting*. Now you know.

**ALICE.** And what are they made of?

**GRYPHON.** Soles and eels, of course, any shrimp could have told you that.

**ALICE.** If I'd been the whiting, I'd have said to the porpoise, keep back please, we don't want *you* with us.

**MOCK.** They were obliged to have him with them. No fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.

**ALICE.** Wouldn't it reaally?

**MOCK.** Of course not. Why if a fish came to me, and told me he was going on a
journey - I should say, with what porpoise?

**ALICE.** Don't you mean "purpose"?

**MOCK.** I mean what I say. Now let's hear some of *your* adventures.

**ALICE.** The queerest thing that happened to me to-day was singing "You are old,
Father William" to the caterpillar, and all the words came different.

**MOCK.** That's very curious.

**GRYPHON.** It's about as curious as it can be.

**MOCK.** The words all came different. I should like to hear her try and sing something now.

**GRYPHON.** Stand up and sing "Tis the voice of the sluggard".
