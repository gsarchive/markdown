## Dialogue following No. 8

*All go off at end of song. QUEEN stops to say to ALICE*


**QUEEN.** Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?

**ALICE.** No, I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.

**QUEEN.** It's the thing Mock Turtle soup is made from.

**ALICE.** I never saw one or heard of one.

**QUEEN.** The Gryphon shall show you.

*Enter GRYPHON*

**QUEEN.** Here Gryphon, introduce this young lady to the Mock Turtle. I must go and see after some executions I have ordered.

*Exit QUEEN*

**GRYPHON.** What fun!

**ALICE.** What *is* the fun?

**GRYPHON.** Why, *she*. It's all her fancy, that, they never executes nobody you know. Hi! Mock Turtle.

*Enter MOCK TURTLE weeping.*

**ALICE.** What is his sorrow?

**GRYPHON.** It's all his fancy - that, he hasn't got no sorrow you know. This here young lady she wants for to know your history, she do.

**MOCK.** I'll tell it her. Sit down, both of you. Once I was a real turtle!

**GRYPHON.** Hjckrrh.

**MOCK.** When we were little we went to school in the Sea. The Master was an old Turtle, we used to call him Tortoise.

**ALICE.** Why did you call him tortoise if he wasn't one?

**MOCK.** We called him tortoise because he taught us. Really you are very dull.

**GRYPHON.** You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question.

**MOCK.** Yes, we went to school in the sea; though you mayn't believe it -

**ALICE.** I never said I didn't.

**MOCK.** You did.

**GRYPHON.** Hold your tongue.

**MOCK.** We had the best of educations; in fact we went to school every day.

**ALICE.** *I've* been to a day school too. You needn't be so proud as all that.

**MOCK.** With extras?

**ALICE.** Yes. We learned French and music.

**MOCK.** And washing?

**ALICE.** Certainly not.

**MOCK.** Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school. Now at ours, they had at the end of the bill, French, music, *and washing* extra.

**ALICE.** You couldn't have wanted it much, living at the bottom of the sea.

**MOCK.** I couldn't afford to learn it. I only took the regular course.

**ALICE.** What was that?

**MOCK.** Reeling and writhing, of course, to being with, and then the different branches of arithmetic. Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.

**ALICE.** I never heard of Uglification. What is it?

**GRYPHON.** Never heard of uglifying. You know what to beautify is, I suppose.

**ALICE.** Yes. It means to make anything prettier.

**GRYPHON.** Well then, if you don't know what to uglify is, you *are* a simpleton.

**ALICE.** What else had you to learn?

**MOCK.** Well, there was Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography, then Drawling - the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel that used to come once a week, he taught us Drawling, and Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.

**ALICE.** What was *that* like?

**MOCK.** Well I can't show you myself. I'm too stiff and the Gryphon never learned it.

**GRYPHON.** Hadn't time. I went to the Classical master though, he was an old crab, *he* was.

**MOCK.** I never went to him, he taught laughing and grief they used to say.

**GRYPHON.** So he did. So he did.

*Both creatures hide faces in their paws in sorrow.*

**ALICE.** And how many hours a day did you do lessons.

**MOCK.** Ten hours the first day, nine the next, and so on.

**ALICE.** What a curious plan.

**GRYPHON.** That's the reason they're called lessons - because they lessen from day to day.

**ALICE.** Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday.

**MOCK.** Of course it was.

**ALICE.** And how did you manage on the twelfth?

**GRYPHON.** That's enough about lessons, sing her a song.
