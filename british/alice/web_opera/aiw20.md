### The Lion and the Unicorn
#### &nbsp;
The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the Crown.
The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town!
Some gave him white bread and some gave him brown,
Some gave him plum cake and drum'd him out of town.
Rataplan, rataplan,
Rataplan, plan, plan, plan, plan.
Rataplan, rataplan,
They drum'd him out of town.
Rataplan, rataplan,
Rataplan, plan, plan, plan, plan.
Some gave him plum cake and drum'd him out of town.
