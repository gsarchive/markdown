### So They Say

#### HARE.
The poor Hatter's very mad,
So they say, so they say.
He's indubitably mad, so they say.
Tho' why hatters should be mad, dear,
Is a puzzle unto me, dear,
But they are mad, all agree, dear, so they say.
So they say, so they say, so they say.

#### HATTER.
Hares in March are very queer,
So they say, so they say.
And the reasons very clear, so they say.
They are sane all thro' the Autumn
But when Springtide winds have caught 'em
Very mad the world has thought 'em, so they say.
So they say, so they say, so they say.

#### ALICE.
He is very bad in March,
So they say, so they say.
And he lives on soap and starch, so they say.
He is mad and so's the hatter,
But I do not mean to flatter,
When I say it does not matter, so they say.
So they say, so they say, so they say.

*All dance off - HARE and HATTER taking table away.*
