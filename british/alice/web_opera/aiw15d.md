## Dialogue following No. 15

*Enter ALICE*


**ALICE.** Here they are! I suppose they've each got TWEEDLE round at the back of the collar.

*They stand still and ALICE is going round to inspect the back of their collars.*


**DUM.** If you think we're waxworks you ought to pay, you know. Wax-works weren't
made to be looked at for nothing. Nohow!

**DEE.** Contrariwise, if you think we're alive you ought to speak.

**ALICE.** I'm sure I'm very sorry.

**DUM.** I know what you're thinking about, but it isn't so, nohow.

**DEE.** Contrariwise, if it was so, it might be, and if it were so, it would be,
but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic.

**ALICE.** I was thinking which is the best way out of this wood. Would you tell me,
please? *(They only look at each other and at her, and grin. ALICE points her finger at TWEEDLEDUM.)* First Boy!

**DUM.** Nohow!

**ALICE.** Next Boy!

**DEE.** Contrariwise!

**DUM.** You've begun wrong. The first thing in a visit is to say "How d'ye do" and shake hands.

*They shake hands with each other and then each give a hand to her. Then the music of "Here we go
round the mulberry bush" commences, and all sing and dance round.*
