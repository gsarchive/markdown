Act I
=====

SCENE. A Forest in Autumn. Alice asleep at foot of tree and Fairies dancing round her.

# CHORUS OF FAIRIES. "Sleep, maiden sleep"

*Fairies torop off at each side, the Chorus dying softly away in the distance. Scene changes to Wonderland, Garden set. The CATERPILLAR discovered smoking on gigantic mushroom at side. ALICE wakes up, and goes up and down stage in great bewilderment. The WHITE RABBIT crosses the stage hurriedly.

RABBIT. Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh, won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!

ALICE. If you please, Sir - *(RABBIT starts and exit dropping white kid gloves and fan.)* Dear! Dear! How queer everything is to-day. And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night. Let me think, was I the same when I got up this morning. But if I'm not the same, who am I? Ah! that's the puzzle. I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: Four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times even - Oh dear, I shall never get to twenty at that rate. I'll try "How doth the little busy bee."

# SONG - How Doth the Little Crocodile

ALICE. Oh! dear, I'm sure those are not the right words, and I'm so very tired of being all alone here.

*Comes opposite CATERPILLAR.*

CATERPILLAR. Who are you?
ALICE: I - I hardly know, Sir, just at present. At least I knew who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.
CATERPILLAR. What do you mean by that? Explain yourself.
A. I can't explain *myself*, I'm afraid, Sir, because I'm not myself, you see.
C. I don't see.
A. I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly, for I can't understand it myself to begin with.
C. You. Who are *you*?
A. I think you ought to tell me who you are first.
C. Why? *(ALICE tosses her head and is going off)* Come back! I've something important to say. *(ALICE returns to him)* Keep your temper.
A. *(indignantly)* Is that all?
C. No. So you think you're changed, do you?
A. I'm afraid I am, Sir. I can't remember things as I used.
C. Can't remember *what* things?
A. Well I've tried "How doth the little busy bee", but it came out different.
C. Try "You are old, Father William".
A. With pleasure, Sir.

# SONG - You are old FW

C. That is not right.
A. Not *quite* right, I'm afraid. Some of the words hae got altered.
C. It's wrong from beginning to end. Good day.

*CATERPILLAR and Mushroom are drawn off. Enter WHITE RABBIT.*

R. The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh! my fur and whiskers. She'll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets. Where can I have dropped them I wonder?
A (aside) He's looking for his fan and gloves.
*She also looks for them. The RABBIT then notices her.*
R. Why, Mary Ann, what *are* you doing out here? Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan. Quick now!
A (aside) He takes me for his housemaid. How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am. But I'd better get him his fan and gloves.
*picks up fan and gloves and gives them to RABBIT*
R. Thank you, Mary Ann, thank you. Now wait for the Duchess, she's cominng here with the baby and the cook.
*exit RABBIT*
A. Oh dear me! I'm Mary Ann now, and the Duchess is coming, and the baby, and the cook. Are they going to cook the baby, I wonder?
*Enter DUCHESS carrying child. COOK with a saucepan and pepper castor, and CHESHIRE CAT*
A. Please would you tell me why your cat grins like that?
D. It's a Cheshire Cat, and that's why. *(to baby)* Pig!
A. I didn't know that Cheshire Cats always grinned; in fact I didn't know that cats *could* grin.
D. They all can and most of 'em do.
A. I don't know of any that do.
D. You don't know much and that's a fact.
C. There's nothing like pepper say I. There's not half enough yet! Nor a quarter enough!
[lyrics formatting]
    Boil it so easily.
    Mix it so greasily,
    Stir it so sneezily,
      One, two, three.
    One for the Missis, two for the cat, and three for the baby.

*The COOK peppers soup and baby alternately.*
A. Oh, *please* mind what you're doing! Oh, there goes his *precious* nose!
D. If everybody minded their own business, the world would go round a great deal faster than it does.
A. Which would *not* be an advantage. Just think what work it would make with the day and night. You see, the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis --
D. Talking of axes, chop off her head.
A. Twenty-four hours, I think - or is it twelve -
D. Oh don't bother me. I never could abide figures.

# SONG - Speak Roughly

D (to COOK) Off with you. *(exit COOK)* Here, catch! *(throws baby off stage)* I'm going to the Queen.
*exeunt DUCHESS, CAT, and RABBIT*
A. I wonder what I'm going to do. I hope the cook caught the baby.
*The head of CHESHIRE CAT appears in tree.*
A. Cheshire Puss. Would you tell me please which way I ought to go from here?
C. That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.
A. I don't much care where.
C. Then it doesn't matter which way you go.
A. So long as I get *somewhere*.
C. Oh you're sure to do that, if you only walk long enough.
A. What sort of people live about here?
C. In one direction lives a Hatter, and in the other a March Hare. Visit either you like - they're both mad.
A. But I don't want to go among mad people.
C. Oh you can't help that. We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.
A. How do you know I'm mad?
C. You must be, or you wouldn't have come here.
A. And how do you know that you're mad?
C. To begin with, a dog's not mad. You grant that?
A. I suppose so.
C. Well then. You see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I grow when I'm pleased and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.
A. I call it *purring* not growling.
C. Call it what you like; and say "thank you for the information".

# DUET Cheshire Puss, my thanks to thee
*dance and exeunt*
*Enter HATTER, MARCH HARE, and DORMOUSE with tea-table which they set and seat themselves at it. Enter ALICE.*
HATTER and HARE. No room! No room!
A. There's plenty of room.
*sits in chair at head of table*
HARE. Have some wine.
A. I don't see any wine.
HARE. There isn't anyy.
A (angril) Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it.
HAR. It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited.
A. I didn't know it was your table. It's laid for a great many more than three.
HAT. Your hair wants cutting.
A (severely) You should learn not to make personal remarks.
HAT (looking astonished) Why is a raven like a writing-desk?
A. I believe I can guess that.
HARE. Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?
A. Exactly so.
HARE. Then you should say what you mean.
A. I do - at least, I mean what I say; that's the same thing you know.
HAT. Not the same thing a bit. You might just as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see".
HARE. You might just as well say that "I like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like".
DOR. You might just as well say that "I breathe when I sleep" is the thing [sic] as "I sleep when I breathe".
HAT. It *is* he same thing with you. *(to ALICE, taking out his watch)* What day of the month is it?
A. The fourth.
HAT. Two days wrong. *(to HARE)* I told you butter wouldn't suit the works.
HARE. It was the best butter.
HAT. Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well, you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.
*HARE takes watch and dips it in cup*
HARE. It was the *best* butter, you know.
A. What a funny watch! It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is.
HAT. Why should it. Does *your* watch tell you what *year* it is?
A. Of course not, but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together.
HAT. Which is just the case with mine. Have you guessed theriddle yet?
A. No, I give it up. What's the answer?
HAT. I haven't the slightest idea.
HARE. Nor I.
A. I think you might do something better with your time than wasting it asking riddles that have no answers.
HAT. If you knew Time as well as I do, you wouldn't talk about wasting *it*. It's *him*.
A. I don't know what you mean.
HAT. Of course you don't, I dare say you never spoke to Time.
A. Perhaps not, but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.
HAT. Ah! that accounts for it. He won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instanc,e suppose that it were nine o'clock in the morning - just time to begin lessons, you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling. Half past one - time for dinner!
HARE. I only wish it was.
A. That would be grand certainly, but then I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know
HAT. Not at first perhaps, but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.
A. Is that the way you manage?
HAT. Not I. We quarrelled last March, just before he went mad, you know *(points to HARE)* it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
    Twinkle, twinkle, little bat,
    How I wonder what you're at!
    Up above the world you fly
    Like a tea-tray in the sky.
Well I'd hardly finished the first erse when the Queen bawled out, "He's murdering the time, off with his head."
A. How dreadfully saage!
HAT. And ever since that, he won't do a thing I ask. It's always six o'clock now.
A. Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?
HAT *(sighing)* Yes, that's it. It's alwayys tea-time, and we've not time to wash the things between whiles.
A. Then you keep moving round, I suppse?
HAT. Exactly so, as the things get used up.
A. But what happens when you come to the beginning again?
HARE. Suppose we change the subject. Wake up, Dormouse, and tell us a story.
D. Once upon a time there were three sisters, and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie, and they lived at the bottom of a well --
A. What did they live on?
D. They lived on treacle.
A. They couldn't have done that, you know, they'd have been ill.
D. So they were - *very* ill.
HARE. Take some more tea
A. I've had nothing yet, so I can't take more.
HAT. You mean you can't take less. It's very easy to take more than nothing.
A. Nobody asked your opinion.
HAT. Who's making personal remarks now?
A (to D) Whhy did they live at the bottom of a well?
D. It was a treacle well.
A. There's no such thing.
HAT and HARE. Hush! Hush!
D. And so these three little sisters, they were learning to draw you know --
A. What did they draw?
D. Treacle.
HAT. I want a clean cup, let's all move one place on.
*HAT moves, followed by DORMOUSE and MARCH HAR. ALICE into MARCH HARE's place.*
A. But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?
HAT. You can draw water out of a water-well, so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well - eh, stupid?
A. But they were *in* the well.
D. Of course they were - well in - they were learning to draw eveything that begins with an M --
A. Why with an <?
HARE: Why not?
D *(half asleep, and pinched by HATTER, gives a little shriek and goes on)* that begins with an M; suh as mouse-traps, and moon, and memory, and muchness; you know how you say things are "much of a muchness", did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?
A. Really, now you ask me, I don't think --
HAT. Then you hsouldn't talk.
A. *(jumping up)* How rude you are!
*All rise from table and come down stage*

# COUPLETS AND CHORUS - SO THEY SAY
*All dance off - HARE and HATTER taking table away. Enter Two, Five, and Seven of Clubs, then KING, QUEEN, and KNAVE of Hearts and other Cards; also ALICE - Procession goes round the stage. Two, Five, and Seven lie down at sides.*
