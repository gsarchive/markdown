ACT II "Through the Looking-Glass"
==================================

ALICE. Dear me I wish they had stayed! *(To LILY)* Oh Tiger-Lily, I wish you could talk?
LILY. We *can* talk, when there's anybody worth talking to!
A (almost in a whisper). And can *all* the flowers talk?
L. As well as *you* can and a great deal louder.
ROSE. It isn't manners for us to begin, you know, and really was wondering when you'd speak. <!-- Now let me see... Yes, yes! Don't speak until you're spoken to! --> Said I to myself, "her face has got some sense in it, though it's not a clever one." Still you're the right colour and that goes a long way.
L. I don't care about the colour! If only her petals curled up a little more she'd be all right!
A. Aren't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here with nobody to take care of you?
R. There's a tree, what else is it good for? <!-- When she found that he was fickle was her great oak tree -->
A. But what could it do if any danger came?
R. It could bark. It says "Bough-wough", and that's why its branches are called boughs.
A. How is it that you can talk so nicely? I've been in many gardens before but none of the flowers could talk!
L. Put your hand down and feel the ground, then you'll know why!
A (feeling the ground). It's very hard, but I don't see what that has to do with it.
L. In most gardens they make the beds too soft, so that the flowers are always asleep.
A. I never thought of that before! Are there any more people in the garden besides me?
R. There's one other flower in the garden that can move about like you. I wonder how you do it, but she's more bushy than you are.
A. Is she like me? *(aside)* There's another little girl in the garden somewhere.
R. Well she has the same awkward shape as you, but she's redder, and her petals are shorter, I think.
L. Her petals are done up close, almost like a Dahlia - not tumbled about anyhow like yours!
A. Does she ever come out here?
R. I daresay you'll see her soon. She's one of the thorny kind!
A. Where does she wear the thorns?
R. Why all round her head of course! I was wondering *you* hadn't got some too. I thought it was the regular rule!
L. She's coming, I can hear her footstep thump, thump, along the gravel walk.

*Enter RED QUEEN*

RED QUEEN. Where do you come from? And where are you going? Look up, speak nicely, and don't twiddle your fingers all the time.
A. I've lost my way.
R. I don't know what you mean by *your* way - all the ways about here belong to me - but why did you come here at all? Curtsey while you're thinking what to say, it saves time.
A. Indeed - I'll try it when I go home, the next time I'm a little late for dinner.
R. It's time for you to answer now, open your mouth a *little* wider when you speak, and always say "Your Majesty".
A. I wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty.
R (patting ALICE's head). That's right, though when you say "garde", *I've* seen gardens compared with which, this would be a wilderness.
A. And I thought I'd try to find my way to the top of that hill.
R. When you say "hill", *I* could show you hills in comparison with which you would call that a valley.
A. No I shouldn't, a hill *can't* be a valley you know. That would be nonsense.
R (shaking her head). You may call it nonsense, but *I've* heard nonsense compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary. Would you like to play Chess?
A (curtseying). Oh yes, your Majesty. What fun it would be. How I wish I was one of you. I wouldn't mind being a pawn if only I might join - though of course I should *like* to be a Queen best.
R. That's easily managed. You can be the White Queen's Pawn, if you like, as Lily's too young to play, and you're in the second square to begin with; when you get to the eighth square you'll be a Queen, come along! You'll see Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

*Takes ALICE by the hand and both run off. Enter TWEEDLEDUM and TWEEDLEDEE solemnly, and take up position side by side, umbrella behind*

# DUET - "Tweedledum and Tweedledee"

*Enter ALICE*

ALICE. Here they are! I suppose they've each got TWEEDLE round at the back of the collar.

*They stand still and ALICE is going round to inspect the back of their collars.*

DUM. If you think we're waxworks you ought to pay, you know. Wax-works weren't made to be looked at for nothing. Nohow!
DEE. Contrariwise, if you think we're alive you ought to speak.
ALICE. I'm sure I'm very sorry.
DUM. I know what you're thinking about, but it isn't so, nohow.
DEE. Contrariwise, if it was so, it might be, and if it were so, it would be, but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic.
A. I was thinking which is the best way out of this wood. Would you tell me, please? *(They only look at each other and at her, and grin. ALICE points her finger at TWEEDLEDUM.) First Boy!
DUM. Nohow!
A. Next Boy!
DEE. Contrariwise!
DUM. You've begun wrong. The first thing in a visit is to say "How d'ye do" and shake hands.
*They shake hands with each other and then each give a hand to her. Then the music of "Here we go round the mulberry bush" commences, and all sing and dance round.*

# TRIO - "Here we go round the mulberry bush"

DUM. That's enough for one dance!
*Both stop suddenly out of breath, music also stops suddenly and they drop her hands.*
ALICE (aside). It would never do to say "How d'ye do" *now*; we seem to have got beyond that somehow. *(aloud)* I hope you're not much tired!
DUM. Nohow! And thank you very much for asking.
DEE. Contrariwise! So *much* obliged! Can you repeat us some poetry?
A (doubtfully). Perhaps I could!
DUM. Nohow!
DEE. Contrariwise! Repeat "The walrus and the Carpenter"?
A. I'm afraid I don't know it!
DUM. Then we'll tell it you.

*Scene opens and discloses sea-shore, and WALRUS and CARPENTER*

# THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER
(is that a song? check song list)

ALICE. I like the Walrus best, because you see he was a *little* sorry for the poor oysters.
DEE. He ate more than the carpenter though. You see he held his handkerchief in front so that the carpenter couldn't count how many he took. Contrariwise!
A. That was mean, then I like the Carpenter best - if he didn't eat so many as the Walrus.
DUM. But he ate as many as he could get.
A (lights rather down). It's getting dark! Do you think it's going to rain?

*TwEEDLEDUM sprpeads a large umbrella over himself and brother.*

DUM. No! I don't think it is, at least, not under *here*! Nohow!
A. But it may outside!
DEE. It may if it chooses, we've no objection. Contrariwise.
A. Selfish things! I shall say good-bye.
*Turns to go when TWEEDLEDUM rushes from under umbrella and seizes her by the wrist*
DUM (in a rage - pointing to small white rattle under tree). Do you see *that*?
A. It's only a rattle - not a rattle-*snake*, you know - only an old rattle, quite old and broken.
DUM (dancing about in a rage, tearing his hair, &c). I knew it was, it's spoilt of course.
A. You needn't be so angry about an old rattle.
DUM. But it isn't old! It's new, I tell you! I bought it yesterday. *(screaming)* My nice new rattle!
*During this TWEEDLEDEE tries to fold himself up in the umbrella with only his head out, in a fright*
DUM (to DEE). Of course you agree to have a battle!
DEE (sulkily, crawling out of umbrella) I suppose so; only *she* must help us to dress up, you know.
*They run off at opposite sides and bring on bolsters, blankets, hearthrugs, and coalscuttles*
DUM. I hope you're a good hand at pinning and tying strings. Every one of these things has got to go on somehow or other!
*They bustle about and dress up, ALICE helping them.*
A (aside). Really they 'll be more like bundles of old clothes by the time they're ready.
DEE. Now for the bolster to keep my head from being cut off! *(ALICE ties it on)* You know it's one o f the most serious things that can possiblyy happen to one in a battle - to get one's head cut off!
DEE (coming up to her to have a coalscuttle tied on). Do I look very pale?
A. Well - yes - a *little*.
DUM. I'm very brave generally, only to-day I happen to have a headache!
DEE. And I've got a toothache, I'm far worse than you!
A. Then you'd better not fight to-day!
DUM. We *must* have a bit of a fight, but I don't care about going on long! What's the time now?
DEE. Half past four.
DUM. Let's fight till six and then have dinner!
DEE. Very well, and *she* can watch us, only you'd better not come *very* close, I generally hit everything I can see when I get really excited.
DUM. And *I* hit everything within reach whether I see it or not!
A (laughing). You must hit the trees pretty often I should think.
DUM. I don't suppose there'll be a tree left standing for ver so far round by the time we've finished.
A. And all about a rattle.
DUM. I shouldn't have minded it so much if it hadn't been a new one.
A (aside). I wish the monstrous crow would come.
DUM (to his brother). There's only one sword *(takes up wooden toy sword)* but you can have the umbrella. It's quite as sharp. *(Stage darker)* Only we must begin quick. It's getting as dark as it can.
*They fence up to each other*
DEE. And darker.
A. What a thick black cloud that is, and how fast it comes! why I do believe it's got wings.
DUM. It's the crow!
*Both rush off frantically. Stage light again, WHITE QUEEN's shawl flies across to ALICE who catches it*

ALICE. Dear me. Here's somebody's shawl being blown away.

*Enter WHITE QUEEN and ALICE puts the shawl on.*
ALICE. Am I addressing the White Queen?
WHITE QUEEN. Well yes; if you call that a-dressing. It isn't my notion of the thing at all.
A. If your Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I'll do it as well as I can.
W. But I don't want it done at all, I've been a-dressing myself for the last two hours.
A (aside). Every single thing's crooked and she's all over pins. *(aloud)* May I put your shawl straight for you?
W. I don't know what's the matter with it. It's out of temper, I think. I've pinned it here and pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it.
A (putting the QUEEN to rights). Come, you look rather better now, but really you should have a lady's-maid.
W. I'm sure I'll take you with pleasure. Two-pence a week and jam every other day.
A (laughing). I don't want you to hire *me*, and I don't care for jam.
W. It's very good jam.
A. Well I don't want any *to-day* at any rate.
W. You couldn't have it if you *did* want it. The rule is jam to-morrow and jam yesterday, but never jam to-day.
A. It must sometimes come to jam to-day.
W. No it can't! It's jam every *other* day, and to-day isn't any *other* day, you know.
A. I don't understand you! It's dreadfully confusing!
W. That's the effect of living backwards! It always makes me a little giddy at first.
A. Living backwards - I never heard of such a thing!
W. But there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both ways.
A. I'm sure *mine* works only one way, I can't remember things before they happen!
W. It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards. Try the other way, sing "Humpty Dumpty" and you'll see what will happen - ta-ta!

*Exit WHITE QUEEN*

A. Sing "Humpy Dumpty"? I wonder what will happen!

# SONG - Humpty Dumpty

*As she finishes, HUMPTY DUMPTY seats himself on the wall at back.*

ALICE. Why, there he is I declare! And how exactly like an egg he is!
HUMPTY. It's very provoking to be called an egg! Very!
A. I said you *looked* like an egg, sir! And some eggs are very pretty you know.
H. Some people have no more sense than a baby! What's your name and business?
A. My name is Alice!
H. It's a stupid name, what does it mean?
A. *Must* a name mean something?
H. Of course it must! *my* name means the shape I am, and a very handsome shape it is too! With a name like yours you might be any shape almost.
A. Why do you sit out here all alone?
H. Why, because there's nobody with me! Did you think I didn't know the answer to that? Ask another.
A. Don't you think you'd be safer down on the ground?
H. What tremendously easy riddles you ask! Of course I don't think so! Why if I ever *did* fall - which there's no chance of - the King has promised me, with his very own mouth -
A. To send all his horses and all his men.
H. Now I declare that's too bad, you've been listening at doors, and behind trees, and down chimneys, or you couldn't have known it.
A. I haven't indeed! It's in a book.
H. Ah well! They may write such things in a book. That's what you call a History of England that is! Now take a good look at me. I'm one who has spoken to a king, *I* am; mayhap you'll never see such another; and to show I'm not proud, you may shake hands with me.
*shakes hands with ALICE*
A. What a beautiful belt you've got on!
H (in a deep growl). It is a *most provoking thing* when a person does not know a cravat from a belt! IT's a cravat, child, and the White King and Queen gave it to me as an un-birthday present!
A. I beg your pardon?
H. I'm not offended!
A. I mean, what *is* an un-birthday present?
H. A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.
A. I like birthday presents best!
H. You don't know what you're talking about! How many days are there in a year?
A. Three hundred and sixty-five.
H. And how many birthdays have you?
A. One.
H. And if you take one from 365, what remains?
A. 364, of course.
H. Well, that shows that there are 364 days when you might get un-birthday present.s
A. Certainly.
H. And only one for birthday presents. That's all, good-bye.
A. Good-bye till we meet again.
H. I shouldn't know you again if we *did* meet, you're so exactly like other people.
A. The face is what one generally goes by.
H. That's just what I complain of. Your face is the same asa everybody has - the two eyes - so *(marking the places in the air with his thumb)*, nose in the middle, mouth under. It's always the same. Now if you had two eyes on the same side of the nose for instance - or the mouth at the top - that would be *some* help.
A. It wouldn't look nice.
H. Wait till you've tried.
A. Good-bye. *(going off)* Of all the unsatisfactory people I ever met!

*Starts and runs off - for HUMPTY falls with a fearful crash off the wall. Enter all the king's horses and all the king's men.*

# CHORUS - "Humpty Dumpty's Fallen Down"

*Enter RED KING and ALICE*

RED KING. I've sent them all. I couldn't send all the horses, you know, because they're wanted; and I haven't sent the two messengers. They're both gone to the town. Just look along the road and tell me if you see either of them.
ALICE. I see nobody on the road.
R. I only wish I had such eyes. To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance too, why it is as much as I can do to see real people.
A (looking off). I see somebody now; but what curious attitudes!
R. Not at all; He's an Anglo-Saxon messenger and those are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. *(Enter Messenger)* His name is Hare, and the other is Hatter. I must have two, you know; one to come and one to go.
A. I beg your pardon!
R. It isn't respectable to beg.
A. I only meant I didn't understand.
R. Didn't I tell you I must have two; one to fetch and one to carry. *(to Messenger)* What's the matter? you alarm me - I feel faint! Give me a ham sandwich. *(Messenger hands one out of bag; KING eats it.)* Another sandwich.
HARE. There's nothing but hay left now.
R. Hay then. *(Hay is handed him and he munches it.)* *(to ALICE)* There's nthing like eating hay when you're faint. *(to Messenger)* Who did you pass on the road?
HARE. Nobody!
R. Quite right, this lady saw him too. So of course nobody walks slower than you.
H. I do my best. I'm sure nobody walks faster than I do.
R. He can't do that, or he'd have been here first. However, tell us what's going to happen.
HARE. I'll whisper it. *(HARE makes a trumpet of his hands, and puts them to KING's ear, then shouts loudly)* They're at it again.
R (jumps). Do you call *that* a whisper? If you do such a thing again, I'll have you buttered. It went through and through my head like an earthquake.
A. Who are at it agai?
R. Why the Lion and the Unicorn fighting for the Crown, and the best of the joke is that it's *my* crown all the time! Here they come!

*Enter LION and UNICORN fighting*

UNICORN (to KING). I had the best of it that time.
R. A little, a little!
U. Come fetch out the plum cake, old man, none of your brown bread for me. *(HARE offers cake to LION, looking at KING)* What a fight we must have for the crown now! *KING trembles*
LION. I should win easy.
U. I'm not so sure of that.
L. Why I beat you all round the town, you know. Didn't I?
ALL. Yes! Yes!

# CHORUS - "The Lion and the Unicorn"

*Exeunt all but ALICE*

ALICE. If that doesn't drum them out of town nothing ever will.

*Enter WHITE KNIGHT brandishing club.*

WHITE KNIGHT. Ahoy! Ahoy! Check! you're my prisoner.
A. I don't want to be anybody's prisoner. I want to be a Queen.
W. So you shall presently. Now I'll say good-bye! You'll be a Queen presently.
A. Good-bye. *(Exit KNIGHT. She follows him off stage, returning at once with a crown on her head.)* And now to be Queen. But what *is* this on my head? A golden crown! How *can* it have got there without my knowing it? *(takes it off, sits down and examines it, and puts it on again)* Well this *is* grand! *(Struts up and down)*

*Enter RED and WHITE QUEENS*
ALICE. If I really am a Queen I should be able to manage it quite well in time *(to RED Q)* Please would you tell me -
RED QUEEN. Speak when you're spoken to.
ALICE. But if everybody obeyed that rule, and if you only spoken when you were spoken to, and the other person always waited for you to begin, you see nobody would ever say anything.
RED QUEEN. Ridiculous! what right have you to call yourself a Queen? You can't be a Queen till you've passed the proper examination. And the sooner we begin it the better.
WHITE QUEEN. Can you do addition? What's one and one, and one and one, and one and one, and one and one, and one and one.
A. I don't know. I lost count.
R. She can't do addition. Can you do subtraction - take nine from eight.
A. Nine from eight I can't, you know, but --
W. She can't do subtraction. Can you do Division. Divide a loaf by a knife, what's the answer to that.
A. I suppose --
R. Bread and butter of course. Try another subtraction sum. Take a bone from the dog, what remains?
A. The bone wouldn't remain of course if I took it; and the dog wouldn't remain, it would come to bite me; and I'm sure I shouldn't remain.
R. Then you think nothing would remain.
A. I think that's the answer.
R. Wrong as usual. The dog's temper would remain. The dog would lose its temper, wouldn't it?
A. Perhaps it would.
R. Then if the dog went away - its temper would remain.
A. They might go different ways.
R. Of course you'll invite us to your party to-night.
A. I didn't know I was to have a party at all.
R. Of course you are.

*Grand procession for the feast - King's men and chessmen. Trumpets sound.*

# SOLO AND CHORUS - "To the Looking-Glass World"

*(Old Tune)*

*ALICE and QUEENS take up position. Joint and Pudding set before them.*
RED QUEEN. We always miss the soup and fish. Put on the joint. *(ALICE takes knife and fork, and hesitates)* You look a little shy, let me introduce you to that leg of mutton. Alice - mutton! mutton - Alice! *(Leg of mutton gets up and bows)*
ALICE. May I give you a slice?
R. Certainly not! It isn't etiquette to cut anyone you've beeen introduced to. Remove the joint!
*Mutton taken off by head and legs. Large plum-pudding brought on.*
A. I won't be introduced to the pudding please, or we shall get no dinner at all! May I give you some?
R (sulkily, growling). Pudding - Alice! Alice - pudding! Remove the pudding!
*They are taking it out*
A. Waiter, bring back the pudding! *(It is brought back, Alice cuts a slice and hands it to QUEEN.)* Let me help you!
PUDDING. What impertinence! I wonder how you'd like it if I were to cut a slice out of *you*, you creature!
R. Now we'll drink your health. Queen Alice's health!
ALL. Queen Alice's health!

# CHORUS - "Alice's Health"

*Gauzes down, and stage dark*

# FINAL CHORUS - "Wake! Alice! Wake!"

*ALICE discovered at foot of tree asleep as in first Act. Slow music, she wakes and rubs her eyes.

ALICE. Oh, I've had such a curious dream!

CURTAIN.




Songs from Chapter IV
Hare. That poor hatter's very bad.
All. So they say, so they say
-- alternates with "all" on those lines

# Humpty Dumpty

Humpty Dumpty's fallen down,
Humpty Dumpty, Humpty Dumpty;
Humpty Dumpty's cracked his crown,
Humpty Dumpty, Humpty Dumpty
But the king keeps his promise,
The king keeps his promise,
The king keeps his promise though horses and men
Can't put Humpty Dumpty together again
Though all the king's horses and king's men may race,
'Tis clear they can never restore to his place, 
Humpty Dumpty, Humpty Dumpty.

# Alice's health

Alice's health,
Long life and wealth,
Never a monarch so mighty was seen
Gaily fill up
Beaker and cup
Drink to our Alice, to Alice the Queen.

# Finale

Wake! Alice! wake! now no longer a rover
Fast fade the Wonderland visions away;
Wake at the Elves' call - the dream-play is over!
Wake! Alice! Wake! to the world of today.
