Songs from Chapter IV
Hare. That poor hatter's very bad.
All. So they say, so they say
-- alternates with "all" on those lines

# Humpty Dumpty

Humpty Dumpty's fallen down,
Humpty Dumpty, Humpty Dumpty;
Humpty Dumpty's cracked his crown,
Humpty Dumpty, Humpty Dumpty
But the king keeps his promise,
The king keeps his promise,
The king keeps his promise though horses and men
Can't put Humpty Dumpty together again
Though all the king's horses and king's men may race,
'Tis clear they can never restore to his place, 
Humpty Dumpty, Humpty Dumpty.

# Alice's health

Alice's health,
Long life and wealth,
Never a monarch so mighty was seen
Gaily fill up
Beaker and cup
Drink to our Alice, to Alice the Queen.

# Finale

Wake! Alice! wake! now no longer a rover
Fast fade the Wonderland visions away;
Wake at the Elves' call - the dream-play is over!
Wake! Alice! Wake! to the world of today.
