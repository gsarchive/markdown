Act I
=====

Dialogue following No. 6:
*Enter Two, Five, and Seven of Clubs, then KING, QUEEN, and KNAVE of Hearts and other
Cards; also ALICE - Procession goes round the stage. Two, Five, and Seven lie down at sides.*

QUEEN (to KNAVE). Who is this? *(KNAVE only bows)* Idiot! *(to ALICE)* What's your name, child?
ALICE. My name is Alice, so please your majesty. *(aside)* Why they're only a pack of cards; I needn't be afraid of them.
QUEEN (pointing to Two, Five, and Seven). And who are *these*?
A. How should *I* know? It's no business of mine.
Q (glares at ALICE and then shouts). Off with her head! off--
KING. Consider, my dear; she is only a child.
Q (to KNAVE). Turn them over. *(Two, Five, and Seven get up and bow rapidly to everyone)* Leave off that, you make me giddy. Off with their heads!
A. You shan't be beheaded. *(shows them off stage)*
RABBIT (to ALICE). It's - it's a very fine day.
A. Very! where's the Duchess?
R. Hush! Hush! She's under sentence of execution.
A. What for?
R. Did you say what a pity?
A. No I didn't. I don't think it at all a pity - I said what for?
R. She boxed the Queen's ears.
A. Oh what fun!
R. Oh hush, the Queen will hear you.
Q. Are their heads off?
KNAVE. Their heads are off, so please your Majesty.
Q. Get to your places!
*KING gives ALICE his hand - KNAVE with QUEEN. Grand Gavotte of Court Cards. At end, head of CHESHIRE CAT appears in tree.
CAT (to ALICE). How do you like the Queen?
A. Not at all. She's extremely - *(QUEEN comes beside her)* polite. *(QUEEN smiles and passes on)*
KING. Who *are* you talking to?
A. It's a friend of mine, a Cheshire Cat.
K. A Cheshire Cat?
A. Allow me to introduce it.
K. I don't like the look of it at all. However it may kiss my hand if it likes.
C. I'd rather not.
K. Don't be impertinent, and don't look at me like that. *(gets behind QUEEN)*
A. A cat may look at a King.
K. Well it must be removed. *(to QUEEN)* My dear, I wish you would have this cat removed.
Q. Off with his head.
K. Hi! Executioner.
KNAVE. Here he is.
*Enter EXECUTIONER*
KING. Off with that cat's head.
E. Can't be donee.
Q. What!
E. You can't cut a head off unless there's a body to cut it off from. I never had to do such a thing before and I'm not going to begin at my time of life.

# TRIO & CHORUS - "HE IS THE EXECUTIONER"

*All go off at end of song. QUEEN stops to say to ALICE*

QUEEN. Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?
ALICE. No, I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.
Q. It's the thing Mock Turtle soup is made from.
A. I never saw one or heard of one.
Q. The Gryphon shall show you.
*Enter GRYPHON*
Q. Here Gryphon, introduce this young lady to the Mock Turtle. I must go and see after some executions I have ordered.
*Exit QUEEN*
GRYPHON. What fun!
A. What *is* the fun?
G. Why, *she*. It's all her fancy, that, they never executes nobody you know. Hi! Mock Turtle.
*Enter MOCK TURTLE weeping.*
A. What is his sorrow?
G. It's all his fancy - that, he hasn't got no sorrow you know. This here young lady she wants for to know your history, she do.
MOCK. I'll tell it her. Sit down, both of you. Once I was a real turtle!
G. Hjckrrh.
M. When we were little we went to school in the Sea. The Master was an old Turtle, we used to call him Tortoise.
A. Why did you call him tortoise if he wasn't one?
M. We called him tortoise because he taught us. Really you are very dull.
G. You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question.
M. Yes, we went to school in the sea; though you mayn't believe it -
A. I never said I didn't.
M. You did.
G. Hold your tongue.
M. We had the best of educations; in fact we went to school every day.
A. *I've* been to a day school too. You needn't be so proud as all that.
M. With extras?
A. Yes. We learned French and music.
M. And washing?
A. Certainly not.
M. Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school. Now at ours, they had at the end of the bill, French, music, *and washing* extra.
A. You couldn't have wanted it much, living at the bottom of the sea.
M. I couldn't afford to learn it. I only took the regular course.
A. What was that?
M. Reeling and writhing, of course, to being with, and then the different branches of arithmetic. Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.
A. I never heard of Uglification. What is it?
G. Never heard of uglifying. You know what to beautify is, I suppose.
A. Yes. It means to make anything prettier.
G. Well then, if you don't know what to uglify is, you *are* a simpleton.
A. What else had you to learn?
M. Well, there was Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography, then Drawling - the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel that used to come once a week, he taught us Drawling, and Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.
A. What was *that* like?
M. Well I can't show you myself. I'm too stiff and the Gryphon never learned it.
G. Hadn't time. I went to the Classical master though, he was an old crab, *he* was.
M. I never went to him, he taught laughing and grief they used to say.
G. So he did. So he did.
*Both creatures hide faces in their paws in sorrow.*
A. And how many hours a day did you do lessons.
M. Ten hours the first day, nine the next, and so on.
A. What a curious plan.
G. That's the reason they're called lessons - because they lessen from day to day.
A. Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday.
M. Of course it was.
A. And how did you manage on the twelfth?
G. That's enough about lessons, sing her a song.

# SONG AND CHORUS: "Beautiful soup so rich and green"

MOCK. You may not have lived under the sea.
ALICE. I haven't.
M. And perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster?
A. I have tasted-- *(checks herself)* No never!
M. So you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is?
A. No indeed! What sort of dance is it?
GRYPHON. Why, you first form into a line along the sea-shore -
M. Two lines! Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way -
G. *That* generally takes some time!
M. You advance twice -
G. Each with a lobster for a partner -
M. Of course, advance twice, set to partners!
G. Change lobsters and retire in same order.
M. Then you throw the--
G. The Lobsters! *(with a shout and bound into the air)*
M. As far out to sea as you can.
G. Swim after them!
M. Turn a somersault in the sea! *(capering about)*
M. Back to ladnd again and that's all the first figure.
*The two creatures who have been jumping about like mad things, now sit down again and look at ALICE.*
A. It must be a very pretty dance!
M. Would you like to see a bit more of it?
A. Very much indeed!
M (to GRYPHON). Come let's try the first figure. We can do it without lobsters you know. You sing.

# SOLO AND CHORUS "Will you walk a little faster?

ALICE. Thank you! It's a very interesting dance; and I do so like that curious song about the whiting.
MOCK. Oh, as to the whiting - you've seen them of course?
A. Yes, I've often seen them at dinn--
M. I don't know where Dinn may be, but if you've seen them so often of course you know what they're like.
A. I believe so, they have their tails in their mouths, and they're all over crumbs.
M. You're wrong about the crumbs, crumbs would all wash off in the sea, but they *have* their tails in their mouths.
GRYPHON. The reasin is they would go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again.
A. Thank you, it's very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.
G. Do you know why it's called a whiting?
A. I never thought about it.
G. It does the boots and shoes. *(solemnly)*
A. *Does* the boots and shoes?
G. Why, what are *your* shoes done with - I mean what makes them so shiny?
A. They're done with *blacking*, I believe.
G. Boots and shoes under the sea are done with *whiting*. Now you know.
A. And what are they made of?
G. Soles and eels, of course, any shrimp could have told you that.
A. If I'd been the whiting, I'd have said to the porpoise, keep back please, we don't want *you* with us.
M. They were obliged to have him with them. No fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.
A. Wouldn't it reaally?
M. Of course not. Why if a fish came to me, and told me he was going on a journey - I should say, with what porpopise?
A. Don't you mean "purpose"?
M. I mean what I say. Now let's hear some of *your* adventures.
A. The queerest thing that happened to me to-day was singing "You are old, Father William" to the caterpillar, and all the words came different.
M. That's very curious.
G. It's about as curious as it can be.
M. The words all came different. I should like to hear her try and sing something now.
G. Stand up and sing "Tis the voice of the sluggard".

# SONG - "Tis the Voice of the Lobster"

GRYPHON. It is time for the trial.
ALICE. What trial.
MOCK. The trial of the Knave of Hearts.

*Trumpets and March music. Enter KING and QUEEN of Hearts, Court Cards, &c. WHITE RABBIT attired as Herald. KNAVE in chains guarded by soldiers.*

KING. Herald, read the accusation.
*WHITE RABBIT blows three blasts on trumpet, unrolls a scroll, and reads.*

RABBIT. The Queen of HEarts she made some tarts
    All on a summer day,
  The knave of Hearts he stole those tarts
    And took them quite away.

KING. Call the first witness.
R (blows trumpet). First witness.

*Enter HATTER with teacup, and bread and butter. Also MARCH HARE and DORMOUSE arm in arm.*
HATTER. I beg your pardon, your Majesty, for bringing these in, but I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.
K. You ought to have finished. When did you begin?
H. Fourteenth of March I *think* it was.
K. Take off your hat.
H. It isn't mine.
K. Stolen!
H. I keep them to sell. I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.

*QUEEN puts on spectacles and glares at him and he fidgets.*

KING. Give your evidence and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot.
*HATTER fidgets and bites a piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter.*
QUEEN. Bring me the list of singers at the last concert.
*HATTER trembles so that he shakes his shoes off.*
K. Give your evidence or I'll have you executed whether you're nervous or not.
H. I'm a poor man, your Majesty, and I hadn't begun my tea - not above a week or so, and what with the bread and butter getting so thin, and the twinkling of the tea -
K. The twinkling of the *what*?
H. It *began* with the tea.
K. Of course twinking *[sic]* begins with a T. Do you take me for a dunce? Go on.
H. I'm a poor man and most things twinkled after that - only the March Hare said -
HARE. I didn't!
HATTER. You did!
HARE. I deny it!
K. He denies it, leave out that part!
HATTER. Well at any rate the Dormouse said -
DORMOUSE. I didn't.
H. You did!
D. I deny it!
H. And after that I cut some more bread and butter.
K. But *what* did the Dormouse say?
H. That I can't remember.
K. You must remember or I'll have you executed!
*HATTER drops teacup, and bread and butter, and goes on his knees*
H. I'm a poor man, your Majesty.
K. You're a very poor speaker! *(applause in Court)* and if that's all you know about it you may stand down.
H. I can't go no lower. I'm on the floor as it is.
K. Then you may *sit* down!
H. I'd rather finish my tea.
K. You may go -- *(HATTER rushes out)*
Q. And just take his head off outside?
K. Call the next witness!
*Enter the Duchess's COOK with pepper pot - one or two sneezes heard near her*
K. Be good enough to take the time from me. Now all together. *(All sneeze. To COOK) Give your evidence.
COOK. Shan't!
K. What are these tarts made of?
C. Pepper mostly.
DORMOUSE. Treacle!
Q. Collar that Dormouse! Behead that Dormpise! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!
*COOK stands back.*
KING. Next witness?
RABBIT (blows trumpet). Alice!
K. What do you know about this business?
ALICE. Nothing!
K. Nothing *whatever*?
A. Nothing whatever!
K. That's very important! In that case consider your verdict.
Q. No no, sentence first, verdict afterwards.
A. Stuff and nonsense.
Q. Hold yor tongue.
A. I won't.
Q. Off with her head.
A. Who cares for you! My verdict is "Not Guilty, but the Knave mustn't steal the tarts again."
ALL. Not guilty! Hurrah!

# FINALE - "Not guilty I declare"

ACT II "Through the Looking-Glass"
SCENE I - The Looking-Glass

ALICE. How nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-Glass Land. I'm sure it's got such beautiful things in it. Let's pretend there's a way of getting through it somehow. Let's pretend the glass has got all soft gauze. So that we can get through. Why it's turning into a sort of dimness I declare. It'll be easy enough to get through.
*Climbs onto mantlepiece, and goes through Looking-glass*

SCENE II - Looking-glass Land. The garden of Live Flowers. Chessmen discovered on stage.

# CHESS CHORUS "Here ranged in due order of battle we stand"

*Dance; at the end of which one of the white pawns falls down, and the WHITE QUEEN rushes to her to pick her up, knocking the WHITE KING down in her haste.*

*WHITE KING and QUEEN on floor. Enter ALICE.*
ALICE. Why the chessmen are walking about!
WHITE QUEEN. My Precious Lily! My Imperial kitten! *tries to get up*
WHITE KING (sitting up and rubbing his nose). Imperial fiddlestick.
*ALICE lifts WHITE QUEEN up to a standing position; also the pawn*
WHITE QUEEN (to KING). Mind the Volcano!
WHITE KING. What Volcano?
WHITE QUEEN. It blew me up onto my legs. Mind you get up in the regular way, don't get blown up!
<-- I think Paramount would agree that kings ought not to be blown up. -->
ALICE (lifting the KING up). Why you'll be hours and hours getting up at that rate. *(the KING is struggling to rise)* I'd far better help you! Hadn't I? *(helps the KING up hastily and dusts him. He makes faces.)* Oh please don't make such faces, my dear! You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you. And don't keep your mouth so wide open! All the dust will get into it! There, now I think you're tidy. *(Holds the KING upright; the moment she lets him go he falls flat on his back.)* Oh! he's fainted.
WHITE KING (to QUEEN). I assure you, my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!
WHITE QUEEN. You haven't got any whiskers?
WHITE KING. The horror of that moment I shall never, *never* forget!
WHITE QUEEN. You will though, if you don't make a memorandum of it?
*KING gets up, takes out memorandum book, and tries to write. ALICE takes hold of his hand and pencil and helps him.*
WHITE KING. My dear, I really must get a thinner pencil! I can't manage this one a bit - it writes all manner of things I don't intend.
WHITE QUEEN (taking it). What manner of things? *That's* not a memorandum of your feelings! *(to ALICE)* Here, you read it, or sing it?
ALICE. Dear me! It's all in some language I don't know.
WHITE QUEEN (to WHITE KNIGHT). Then you read it!

# SONG - "Jabberwocky"

*All rush off. ALICE alone.*

ALICE. Dear me I wish they had stayed! *(To LILY)* Oh Tiger-Lily, I wish you could talk?
LILY. We *can* talk, when there's anybody worth talking to!
A (almost in a whisper). And can *all* the flowers talk?
L. As well as *you* can and a great deal louder.
ROSE. It isn't manners for us to begin, you know, and really was wondering when you'd speak. <!-- Now let me see... Yes, yes! Don't speak until you're spoken to! --> Said I to myself, "her face has got some sense in it, though it's not a clever one." Still you're the right colour and that goes a long way.
L. I don't care about the colour! If only her petals curled up a little more she'd be all right!
A. Aren't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here with nobody to take care of you?
R. There's a tree, what else is it good for? <-- When she found that he was fickle was her great oak tree -->
A. But what could it do if any danger came?
R. It could bark. It says "Bough-wough", and that's why its branches are called boughs.
A. How is it that you can talk so nicely? I've been in many gardens before but none of the flowers could talk!
L. Put your hand down and feel the ground, then you'll know why!
A (feeling the ground). It's very hard, but I don't see what that has to do with it.
L. In most gardens they make the beds too soft, so that the flowers are always asleep.
A. I never thought of that before! Are there any more people in the garden besides me?
R. There's one other flower in the garden that can move about like you. I wonder how you do it, but she's more bushy than you are.
A. Is she like me? *(aside)* There's another little girl in the garden somewhere.
R. Well she has the same awkward shape as you, but she's redder, and her petals are shorter, I think.
L. Her petals are done up close, almost like a Dahlia - not tumbled about anyhow like yours!
A. Does she ever come out here?
R. I daresay you'll see her soon. She's one of the thorny kind!
A. Where does she wear the thorns?
R. Why all round her head of course! I was wondering *you* hadn't got some too. I thought it was the regular rule!
L. She's coming, I can hear her footstep thump, thump, along the gravel walk.

*Enter RED QUEEN*

RED QUEEN. Where do you come from? And where are you going? Look up, speak nicely, and don't twiddle your fingers all the time.
A. I've lost my way.
R. I don't know what you mean by *your* way - all the ways about here belong to me - but why did you come here at all? Curtsey while you're thinking what to say, it saves time.
A. Indeed - I'll try it when I go home, the next time I'm a little late for dinner.
R. It's time for you to answer now, open your mouth a *little* wider when you speak, and always say "Your Majesty".
A. I wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty.
R (patting ALICE's head). That's right, though when you say "garde", *I've* seen gardens compared with which, this would be a wilderness.
A. And I thought I'd try to find my way to the top of that hill.
R. When you say "hill", *I* could show you hills in comparison with which you would call that a valley.
A. No I shouldn't, a hill *can't* be a valley you know. That would be nonsense.
R (shaking her head). You may call it nonsense, but *I've* heard nonsense compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary. Would you like to play Chess?
A (curtseying). Oh yes, your Majesty. What fun it would be. How I wish I was one of you. I wouldn't mind being a pawn if only I might join - though of course I should *like* to be a Queen best.
R. That's easily managed. You can be the White Queen's Pawn, if you like, as Lily's too young to play, and you're in the second square to begin with; when you get to the eighth square you'll be a Queen, come along! You'll see Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

*Takes ALICE by the hand and both run off. Enter TWEEDLEDUM and TWEEDLEDEE solemnly, and take up position side by side, umbrella behind*

# DUET - "Tweedledum and Tweedledee"

*Enter ALICE*
