## Dialogue following No. 19

*Enter GRIFFENFELD, also NANNA with ERLING, THORA with TORTENSSEN, DAME CORTLANDT
with SYNDIC, and CHRISTINA alone*

**GRIFFENFELD.** Stop! You can all go home. There will be no weddings to-day.

**ALL.** What do you mean?

**GRIFFENFELD.** I mean that you’ve all been imposed upon — deluded — cheated. The Regent is
no Regent, but a common vagabond personating him. Ha! ha! ha! Here comes His
Royal Highness in his true colours!

*Enter REGENT in his vagabond dress. CHRISTINA runs to his arms*

**ERLING** *(to REGENT).* Now, sir, the truth. Are you a prince to be worshipped or a swindler to be
whipped?

**REGENT.** Really it’s a point upon which I’m not quite satisfied myself! I’ll think it over and
let you know.

*Enter the two OFFICERS*

**1ST OFFICER** *(kneeling).* Sir, the enemy’s fleet has entered the Baltic, and your immediate
presence at Copenhagen is indispensable. *(Giving a dispatch to REGENT.)*

**GRIFFENFELD.** Why, what’s all this? Who are these jack-a-dandies?

**REGENT** *(reading dispatch).* Merely two of my trusted officers. They bring me weighty news
indeed!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Why, you don’t mean to tell me that you are the Regent, after all?

**REGENT.** The very Regent, at your service. *(All kneel.)*

**GRIFFENFELD.** I’ve made an ass of myself!

**REGENT.** Don’t say that. We are indebted to you for some invaluable hints for promotions,
appointments, and marriage arrangements, all of which will take effect to-day —
as indeed will the best and wisest of your suggestions — your permanent
degradation to the ranks. *(REGENT sees CHRISTINA weeping.)* Why, Christina in
tears!

**CHRISTINA.** I weep, sir, because my heart is broken, and, alas, it is your Highness’s doing, for
your Highness gave me Nils Egilsson, and he has gone from me for ever!

**REGENT.** Nay, Christina, be not so sure of that. I have found the very love I have sought
this many a year, and if my being heir to a crown is to stand in my way, why I’ll
e’en be Nils Egilsson to the end!

**CHRISTINA** *(amazed.)* Sir!

**REGENT.** Come, Christina, what say you?

**CHRISTINA.** Sir, I am your Highness’s handmaid!

*They retire up stage together.*
