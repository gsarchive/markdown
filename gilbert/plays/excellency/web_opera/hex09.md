#### REGENT.
&nbsp;
I’ve grasped your scheme, if I can say as much without intrusion:
As Regent-Prince I must ennoble all without exclusion,
And scatter honours all around with liberal profusion —
Then you’ll step in and, with a word, dispel the fond illusion!
#### GRIFFENFELD.
Then I’ll step in —
#### REGENT.
Then you’ll step in —
#### GRIFFENFELD.
And with a word —
#### REGENT.
And with a word —
Then you’ll step in and, with a word, dispel the fond illusion!
#### GRIFFENFELD *(excitedly).*
&nbsp;
Exactly so! exactly so! exactly so! exactly so!
For understand what I require —
Give every man his heart’s desire,
Then I’ll explain the ins and outs —
In half an hour or thereabouts!
#### BOTH.
Then I’ll/you’ll explain the ins and outs —
In half an hour or thereabouts!
#### ENSEMBLE.
Oh, human joy at best is brief —
Alas, too soon it’s turned to grief!
So it’s our duty, you’ll allow,
Our fellow creatures to endow
With happiness complete and vast —
#### REGENT.
Although that happiness may last —
#### GRIFFENFELD.
Although that happiness may last —
#### BOTH.
But half an hour or thereabouts!
But half an hour —
But half an hour —
But half an hour or thereabouts!

*Exit GRIFFENFELD. CHRISTINA comes forward from behind statue.*

#### CHRISTINA.
I overheard!
#### REGENT.
You did? Confusion!
But not a word
Of this delusion —
No single phrase —
No faint suggestion —
To haply raise
A doubt or question!
If fault or blunder visible
I make in this experiment —
Control your muscles risible,
And check untimely merriment.
Address me most respectfully —
Regard with silent shyness me —
With eyes cast down subjectively; —
And mind you “Royal Highness” me!
Now don’t forget — now don’t forget,
 Be sure you “Royal Highness” me!
#### CHRISTINA.
With all devotion beautiful,
I’ll favour your expedient —
I’ll be your very dutiful —
I’ll be your most obedient —
You’ll find me all docility,
You miracle of slyness, you!
I’ll curtsey with humility,
And always “Royal Highness” you!
I won’t forget — I won’t forget —
I’ll always “Royal Highness” you!
#### ENSEMBLE.
Oh, never was seen
Such a pearl of a Prince,
With his/my dignified mien 
He is/I am sure to convince:
In his/my gracious address
There is Royalty shown —
And a baby could guess
He’s/I’m the heir to a throne!
Ha! ha! ha! ha! — Ha! ha! ha! ha!
Oh a baby could guess he’s the heir to a throne!
*Exit in opposite directions.*
