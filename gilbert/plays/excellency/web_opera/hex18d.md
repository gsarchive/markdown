## Dialogue following No. 18

**THORA** *(sighing).* Oh, Nanna, they’re good fellows! I wish it was all real!

**NANNA.** No use wishing, dear. We’d better try and forget all about them. *(Looking off.)* Oh
— look! All the people coming to get married!

**THORA.** Poor people! We — we must go and find our bridegrooms.

**NANNA.** Poor bridegrooms? It’s — it’s a capital joke! *(About to cry.)*

**THORA.** Capital! *(Looking at NANNA’s face).* Why, a real tear, I do believe!

**NANNA** *(holding it on her finger).* Yes, it’s real this time.

**THORA** *(examining it).* Funny, isn’t it?

**NANNA.** Very amusing.

**THORA.** Put it back. *(NANNA does so.)* All right now?

**NANNA** *(brightly).* All right now!

*Exeunt in opposite directions*
