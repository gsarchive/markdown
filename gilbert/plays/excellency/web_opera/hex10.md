#### DAME.
Now all that we’ve agreed upon, O —
And all that’s passed between us —
No human soul must know,
Be he a friend or foe.
#### SYNDIC.
You lean no broken reed upon, O —
In Courts of Law and Venus
(I’ve practiced much in both)
I’m always on my oath!
#### DAME.
What always?
#### SYNDIC.
Always!
#### DAME.
Always?
#### SYNDIC.
Always!
Always on my oath!
You’ll find I am
Discreetly dumb,
So trust me, ma’am —
#### DAME.
The word is mum —
#### SYNDIC.
Of all I know
I’ll give no clue,
You little ro-
Guey poguey, you!
You little roguey poguey!
#### DAME *(indignantly).*
Sir!
#### SYNDIC.
You little roguey poguey!
#### DAME.
Sir!!
#### SYNDIC.
You roguey poguey, roguey poguey, roguey poguey!
#### DAME.
Sir!!!
#### ENSEMBLE.
&nbsp;

| DAME *(aside).* | SYNDIC *(aside).* |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Although of men’s vulgarity, O — | If called upon in charity, O — |
| I’m no unfair inquisitor, | To justify my visitor, |
| I hate familiarity, O — | I’ll quote my popularity, O — |
| In a family solicitor! | As a family solicitor! |

#### BOTH.
As a family, family, family, family — A family solicitor!
#### DAME.
Your tone is not professional, O —
It’s neither grave nor courtly:
Such lack of common-sense
Inspires no confidence.
#### SYNDIC.
By gradual steps progressional, O —
I’ll reach the haven shortly;
But till the moment sweet
I’ll never be indiscreet.
#### DAME.
What never?
#### SYNDIC.
Never!
#### DAME.
Never?
#### SYNDIC.
Never!
Never be indiscreet!
*(dancing).* Those lips command,
And I obey,
Though close at hand
That joyous day
When I may sip
Their honey dew —
You little pipSy wipsy you!
You little pipsy wipsy!
#### DAME.
Sir!
#### SYNDIC.
You little pipsy wipsy!
#### DAME.
Sir!!
#### SYNDIC.
You pipsy wipsy pipsy wipsy pipsy wipsy!
#### DAME.
Sir!!!
#### ENSEMBLE.

| DAME *(aside).* | SYNDIC *(aside).* |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| What sentiments transgressional! O — | These gradual steps progressional, O — |
| It’s bad, I’ve understood, for them, | Wait any time I would for them — |
| When gentlemen professional, O — | When gentlemen professional, O — |
| Take more than is quite good for them! | Gain widows rich, it’s good for them! |

#### BOTH.
When gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen —
{Take more than is good for them! 
{Widows gain, it’s good for them!

*Exeunt separately*
