## Dialogue following No. 13

**REGENT** *(changing his manner — very humbly).* I trust I’ve fairly carried out your Excellency’s
instructions?

**GRIFFENFELD.** You’ve done pretty well, sir — only pretty well!

**REGENT.** May I ask in what respect I have failed?

**GRIFFENFELD.** Your manner is not sufficiently dignified for a Royal Prince — you want a great
deal more of this sort of thing — *(business)* — you are not at all Royal, sir!

**REGENT.** I see what you mean. *(Imitating him.)* Thank you, I’m sure — it will be most
useful to me in my profession, and I’ll take care to remember it. But pray bear in
mind that, as a poor stroller, I have not enjoyed your Excellency’s many
opportunities of making myself acquainted with the deportment of the very
highest classes.

**GRIFFENFELD.** True, but I told you this afternoon that you must endeavour to assume an air of —
of this sort of thing — *(business).* Then again, your instructions were to order me
to be shot in twenty-four hours. Why didn’t you do that?

**REGENT.** Well, I was about to give the order, but when I saw the temper of the people and
how cordially you are detested — most unjustly, I’m sure — I was afraid to do so
lest, in their fury, they should execute the order on the spot.

**GRIFFENFELD.** I see what you mean.

**REGENT.** I might not have had time to stop them.

**GRIFFENFELD.** Very true.

**REGENT.** But it’s not too late — they can be sent for directly and the order given, without
delay. *(About to go off.)*

**GRIFFENFELD.** No — on second thoughts it’s not necessary. It will do as it is.

**REGENT.** I trust you think I exercised a wise discretion?

**GRIFFENFELD.** Well, on the whole, perhaps yes. I say — it’s — it’s a good joke, isn’t it?

**REGENT.** It’s a perfect monument of practical humour. Only — forgive the suggestion —
isn’t it a little risky?

**GRIFFENFELD.** Risky? What do you mean?

**REGENT.** Somehow these practical jokes have such a tendency to recoil on the heads of
their perpetrators. Now, mere verbal humour is so much safer — a quip, a crank, a
jibe, jape or jest ——

**GRIFFENFELD.** Nonsense, sir, don’t talk to me about japes and jests! Return to the Castle, and
when you’ve resumed your rags, I will pay you the golden Friedrichs I promised
you. Be off!

**REGENT.** As your Excellency pleases. *(Exit REGENT into Castle.)*

**GRIFFENFELD.** What does he mean about practical jokes recoiling on their perpetrator? I ought to
know. I’ve played them with impunity for five-and-forty years! It’s all very well
to talk about verbal humour, but where is it to come from? Why, everything of the
kind has been said — there’s absolutely nothing left!
