## Dialogue following No. 10

*Enter ERLING SYKKE, with large unopened official letter in his hand*

**ERLING.** At last — the reply to my letter announcing to His Majesty the completion of the
statue! Every hope and every fear of my life lies within the four corners of this
document. What may it not contain? Perhaps an order on the King’s Treasurer for
my ten thousand rix-dollars! Perhaps my appointment as Court sculptor! Perhaps
even my patent of Countship! I tremble so that I can scarcely open it!

*NANNA has entered at the back. She creeps up to him with suppressed fun in her face.*

**NANNA.** Oh, what a big letter! Whom is it from, and what’s it all about?

**ERLING.** Nanna, this letter is to seal your destiny and mine — so, as you are as much
concerned with it as I am, I think we ought to open it together. It’s — it’s from
the King’s private Secretary!

**NANNA.** Oh, do be quick and let’s see what’s in it!

**ERLING.** You open it — I can’t! *(Giving her the letter.)*

**NANNA.** I can. Now then — one! two! three! *(NANNA opens it.)*

**ERLING.** Read — read!

**NANNA** *(looking at it).* Oh! I don’t think you’ll like it. Oh! I’m sure you won’t like it! *(Reads.)*
“Sir — In reply to a letter in which you announce the completion of a statue of
His Royal Highness Prince Frederick, alleged by you to have been commissioned
by His Majesty, I have to inform you that His Majesty knows nothing about it.”

**ERLING** *(stunned).* Knows nothing about it!

**NANNA.** There seems to be some mistake.

**ERLING.** Some mistake! Why, what do you mean?

**NANNA.** Why that, at the first blush, it bears the appearance of being one of dear papa’s
practical jokes.

**ERLING.** But it’s ruin! Absolute ruin! Why, I spent every penny I possessed on the marble
alone!

**NANNA.** I’m so sorry!

**ERLING.** Sorry! I can’t realize it! It stuns me! It’s too cruel — too cruel! And the promise
you made me ——

**NANNA.** Oh, the promise! Yes — es — the *conditional* promise.

**ERLING.** Don’t tell me that was a hoax too! Give me some hope to cling to! I can bear it all
if you’ll only tell me that *you* won’t discard me!

**NANNA.** Really, it’s extremely awkward; but one must be a little prudent. I’m a very
expensive young lady, and as it seems that you have no immediate prospect of
being able to maintain an establishment, it would be really criminal on my part to
involve you in further embarrassments.

*ERLING sinks helplessly on pedestal of statue, and buries his head in his hands*
