## Dialogue following No. 8

**CHRISTINA.** It is pleasant to know that we are of kindred lot, for if you are a strolling player,
why I am but a poor ballad-singer, and out callings have much in common. I am 
at my ease now, but at first — you will laugh at me, I know — I almost thought I
was speaking to the Regent himself!

**REGENT.** I have been given to understand that there is a certain resemblance.

**CHRISTINA.** It is marvellous! Do you know his Highness, sir? *(Anxiously.)*

**REGENT.** Well, I can scarcely say. We have never met, face to face.

**CHRISTINA** *(disappointed).* Then you do *not* know him.

**REGENT.** Very good — then I do *not* know him: but — I know his tailor.

**CHRISTINA.** His tailor?

**REGENT.** Yes. I frequently see his tailor, and his tailor tells me, in strictest confidence, that
*(impressively)* his Highness is *at least three inches more round the waist* than he
is here represented to be! So be prepared for a disappointment!

**CHRISTINA** *(laughing).* Why, sir, I believe there is nothing in this wide world that concerns me
less than the measure of his Highness’s waist! Such a trifle weighs but little with
*me*.

**REGENT** *(aside).* It weighs a good deal with me! *(Aloud.)* And do you pass much time in the
society of his highness’s effigy?

**CHRISTINA.** Why, in truth, much more than is prudent.

**REGENT.** Oh, *he* won’t hurt you — I should say that you were quite safe with *him*. But
beware of the Regent himself, for men say that he is a terrible Turk!

**CHRISTINA.** The Regent, sir, is nought to me. Yet, to speak truly, I am loth to believe that
there can be aught but good in one whom that statue so strongly resembles!

**REGENT.** Then — I may take it that you do not believe there is much of evil in me?

**CHRISTINA** *(confused).* Why, sir — in truth — nay, this is scarcely fair dealing. I spake not of
yourself, but of the Regent.

**REGENT.** And I so strongly resemble him!

**CHRISTINA.** I think, sir, I will go.

**REGENT.** Nay, be not angry with me for drawing so pleasant a conclusion from premises of
your own making! *(Tenderly.)* I would fain hope that you are not angry with me.

**CHRISTINA.** Nay, sir, I am not angry. I spake foolishly, and — I am well served. But I have
tarried too long; I have to go to the Castle Green — I am to sing there.

**REGENT.** Why, I am likewise bound thither, for I have to see the Governor. *(Tenderly.)*
Who knows but that we may meet again!

**CHRISTINA** *(moved).* It is very like. *(Recovering herself.)* But the day is speeding, and I have to
sing for my supper. So fare you well, Master —!

**REGENT.** Nils Egilsson. *(Kissing her hand.)*

**CHRISTINA** *(dreamily).* Nils Egilsson: I shall not forget that name, be very sure!

*Exit CHRISTINA.*

**REGENT.** Well, as a bachelor heir-apparent, I’ve had a tolerably comprehensive experience
of young ladies; but of all the maids I ever met, this is the fairest, the most
winning, and the most original! What a refreshing experience! It’s like the breath
of the hay-field after a season of hot ball-rooms! We shall meet again, my pretty
ballad-singer, unless I greatly err. And now to encounter this precious Governor.

*Enter GOVERNOR GRIFFENFELD*

**GRIFFENFELD.** The Syndic has received his charmer’s letter, and he’s on the tip-toe of
expectation and delight. I shall get rid of her — I shall get rid of her!

**REGENT.** Not knowing the lady, but speaking on general principles, I should say that you
couldn’t do better.

**GRIFFENFELD.** Hallo, sir, who are you to presume to convert into a duologue that which was
intended for a soliloquy?

**REGENT.** I’m Nils Egilsson — strolling player — sadly out of repair, and greatly in need of
a handsome salary, paid weekly in advance.

**GRIFFENFELD.** A professional rogue, eh?

**REGENT.** Well — a technical rogue — much as a lawyer is a technical gentleman — that is
to say, by Act of Parliament.

**GRIFFENFELD.** You pipe to a sharp note, sir. We keep a cage for such gaol-birds as you. *(Aside.)*
Where have I seen this fellow’s face?

**REGENT.** Well, I think I sing best behind bars.

**GRIFFENFELD** *(aside).* Where have I seen this fellow’s face?

**REGENT.** Surely you’re not the Governor?

**GRIFFENFELD.** Yes, sir, I am the Governor of this Province.

**REGENT.** A thousand pardons! I took you for the borough constable. A hasty conclusion
based upon a commendable absence of that superficial polish which the vulgar are
but too apt to associate with the conception of a gentle man. The Governor!
*(Bowing.)* A worshipful gentleman, I’ll be sworn, appearances notwithstanding. A
thousand pardons!

**GRIFFENFELD** *(who, during this speech, has been studying the REGENT’s face).* I have it! It’s the
statue! Why, he’s marvellously like it! *(Aloud.)* Hark ye, sirrah! you are an actor,
you say?

**REGENT.** A poor actor.

**GRIFFENFELD.** Ready at a moment’s notice to play any part that may be entrusted to you? Kings,
princes, and so forth?

**REGENT.** Why, I’m famous for my kings. There’s an air of aristocratic impudence about me
— you may have remarked it — which is eminently suited to your monarchs of
genteel comedy. My tyrants, too, are much admired. “What, bearded to our face,
and by a very boy? The moat is dry — load him with chains, and stifle him in its
reeking mud! Ha! ha! I *will* be obeyed!”

**GRIFFENFELD.** Yes — that’s not good, you know. Rather amateurish, I should say. Played a long
engagement in the Theatre Royal Back Drawing Room, I should imagine. By the
way, have you ever heard it remarked that you bear a close resemblance to a very
dignified personage?

**REGENT.** Eh? Oh, you mean the man who mends boots on the quay. That’s very likely —
he’s my aunt.

**GRIFFENFELD.** The man who mends fiddlesticks!

**REGENT.** I don’t think I know him.

**GRIFFENFELD.** No, sir — not to the man who mends boots — to no less a person than the Prince
Regent of Denmark.

**REGENT.** The Prince Regent?

**GRIFFENFELD.** There he is. He’s a common-looking fellow, and you are singularly like him.
*(Pointing to statue.)*

**REGENT.** You flatter me, I’m sure *(looking at statue).* Well, some fellows have the deuce’s
own luck. Here is a man — the heir to a throne — caressed, courted, and flattered
by the highest in the land — pampered with every luxury that the ingenuity of the
devil or man can devise — and, hang me! if, in addition to all this, he isn’t exactly
like me! It’s enough to turn the fellow’s head!

**GRIFFENFELD.** He’s an ugly fellow, sir, and so are you. Therein lies the chief resemblance. Now
attend to me. If you will consent to personate His Highness for twenty-four hours,
acting exactly as I shall prescribe to you, you shall have — well, you shall have
five golden Friedrichs!

**REGENT.** Five golden Friedrichs!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Then you consent?

**REGENT.** Consent? What is there that I wouldn’t consent to for five golden Friedrichs? But
my dress — it’s a convenient outfit for summer weather; but not, I should say,
what the Regent of Denmark would wear — except, perhaps, in the bosom of his
family after the cares of State are over for the day.

**GRIFFENFELD.** I’ve provided for that. The sculptor of that statue borrowed a left-off suit of the
Regent’s from His Highness’s valet — for artistic purposes. It’s now at the
Castle, packed up, ready to be returned. I should say it would fit you to a nicety.

**REGENT** *(aside).* I’ve not the least doubt of it. When am I to begin?

**GRIFFENFELD.** To-morrow morning. It’ll be great fun!

**REGENT.** It will be a tremendous joke.

**GRIFFENFELD.** So original! With such possibilities! Fancy — a sham Regent dispensing sham
wealth and sham honours untold on all my sham friends — and then their
disappointment when they discover that it’s only my fun!

**REGENT.** Ha! ha! I’m longing to begin!

*During the last few lines, CHRISTINA has entered. She listens, concealed behind statue.*
