#### ERLING and TORTENSSEN.
Now all that we’ve agreed upon, O,
And all that’s passed between us;
Ere half an hour go by
We’ll surely rectify.
#### NANNA and THORA.
As life’s career we speed upon, O,
So fondly we’ll demean us;
Thy love shall never say
That she repents this day.
#### ERLING and TORTENSSEN.
What, never?
#### NANNA and THORA.
Never!
#### ERLING and TORTENSSEN.
Never?
#### NANNA and THORA.
Never!
#### ALL FOUR.
Never repents this day!
#### ERLING and TORTENSSEN.
Resentment sink
My own { Nanna/Thora }.
#### NANNA and THORA.
But only think
Of poor papa.
Position low
Degraded to!
*(pointing to GRIFFENFELD, who is standing sentry.)*
#### ERLING and TORTENSSEN.
You little ro-
Guey poguey, you —
#### SYNDIC.
You little roguey poguey —
#### GRIFFENFELD *(hurt).*
Sir!
#### HAROLD.
You little roguey poguey —
#### GRIFFENFELD.
Sir!!
#### ALL.
You roguey poguey, roguey poguey, roguey poguey.
#### GRIFFENFELD.
Sir!!!
#### ALL.
Who love with all sincerity, O,
And pleasure is elating us —
Away with all celerity, O,
The priest is there awaiting us!
In verity, verity, verity, verity,
Priest is there awaiting us!
*All except REGENT and CHRISTINA dance off in couples into the Castle, waving an adieu to
GRIFFENFELD, who stands as sentry, presenting arms to them as the curtain falls.*
