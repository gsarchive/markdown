#### SYNDIC *(to SENTRY).*
One day, the Syndic of this town
(Whose time of life is shady)
Affectionately kneeling down,
Proposed to this old lady.
Now your opinion give politely
And riddle me this and riddle me rightly —
Who claims her hand? *(aside.)* Here’s half-a-crown! *(tipping him.)*
#### SENTRY.
No doubt the Syndic of this town.
#### SYNDIC *(dancing).*
Exactly so — the truth you speak —
*(to DAME).* Away — your love-sick Syndic seek —
You have no claim upon me, for
Unhappily I’m the Governor!
#### SENTRY.
Oh yes, he is the Governor!
#### SYNDIC.
There!
#### SENTRY.
No doubt he is the Governor!
#### SYNDIC.
There!
#### SENTRY.
Against you, ma’am, I must declare —
The gentleman is the Governor!
#### SYNDIC.
There!
#### DAME.
But bless my soul —
#### SYNDIC.
The man is right!
#### DAME.
That’s not the whole —
#### SYNDIC.
It’s settled quite!
### ENSEMBLE.

| DAME. | SYNDIC.
|-|-
| It’s now my turn my wrongs to air, | I’ve taken steps the Court to square,
| So Governor Munck for squalls prepare! | So fire away, ma’am — I don’t care!

*During the Ensemble a corporal’s guard enters — the SENTRY is relieved, and GRIFFENFELD,
now dressed as a private Hussar, is left in his place. The change is not noticed by the DAME or SYNDIC.*

#### DAME.
One moment, pray — your words retrace,
Oh, sentinel shortsighted!
I to the Governor of this place
My troth securely plighted —
Now pray don’t treat the question lightly,
But riddle me this and riddle me rightly —
Who claims my conjugal embrace?
#### GRIFFENFELD.
Of course, the Governor of this place!
#### DAME *(dancing).*
Exactly so! you well decide!
I am, ha! ha! the Governor’s bride —
The Governor you, you can’t deny —
Argal, the Governor’s lady, I!
#### GRIFFENFELD.
She is the Governor’s lady!
#### SYNDIC.
What!
#### GRIFFENFELD.
Of course, the Governor’s lady!
#### SYNDIC.
What!
#### GRIFFENFELD.
You are the Governor’s lady!
#### SYNDIC.
What!
#### GRIFFENFELD.
You are the Governor, are you not?
Then she’s the Governor’s lady!
#### SYNDIC.
What!
But bless my heart —
#### DAME *(still dancing).*
That man is right!
#### SYNDIC.
That’s but a part —
#### DAME.
It’s settled quite!
### ENSEMBLE.

| DAME. | SYNDIC. | GRIFFENFELD *(aside).*
|-|-|-
| Though basely you may plan and plot, | If I consent, may I be shot, | How capitally I plan and plot
| With me you’ll share the Governor’s lot! | With her to share my Governor’s lot! | To cleverly cut the Gordian knot!

*DAME dances off in front of SYNDIC, who tries in vain to escape.*
