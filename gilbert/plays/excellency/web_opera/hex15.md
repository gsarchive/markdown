#### HAROLD.
There once was a corporal bold —
#### BLANCA.
Yes — gawky, round-shouldered, and lean —
#### HAROLD.
No, very good-looking with plenty of dash,
In battle courageous, hot-headed, and rash,
With a small but extremely becoming moustache —
#### BLANCA.
Ah! it isn’t the one that I mean.

**HAROLD** *(speaks).* Now it’s your turn.
{:.spoken}

#### BLANCA.
There was once a Vivandière —
#### HAROLD.
Old,
Short, stumpy, red-headed, and vain —
#### BLANCA.
Not at all — very young with no sort of defect,
Exceedingly lovely and highly correct.
#### HAROLD.
Oh, don’t make her pretty — these girls, recollect,
Are always remarkably plain!

**BLANCA.** *(speaking).* Rather rude, isn’t it?
**HAROLD.** Not a bit. True to life — that’s all. Now we must have an incident.
**BLANCA.** Suppose we make her — *(Whispers.).*
**HAROLD.** No — Mudie wouldn’t take it. No, I don’t think that would do. Stop, I have an
idea for a sensational incident of a striking and dramatic character.
{:.spoken}

#### &nbsp;
The Regent one morning, by chance,
Observing the Corporal, said —
“It would be nothing short of a public disgrace
To keep such a trump in a Corporal’s place —
So we’ll make him a Colonel, all covered with lace.”
#### BLANCA *(to audience).*
The Regent was weak in the head!
#### HAROLD.
She, taking the facts at a glance,
To his bosom unblushingly flew —
#### BLANCA.
And he was so deeply in love, I declare,
That he married her then, and he married her there —
#### BOTH.
So it ends with a wedding at Hanover Square,
And a three volume novel should do!
*Exeunt together*
