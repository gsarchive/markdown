## Dialogue following No. 1

**ERLING.** That’s a typical instance of feminine perversity — doesn’t fall in love with me,
which would be rational enough, but with the senseless inanimate work of my
hands! My dear fellow *(addressing statue)*, I little thought, when I cut you out,
that in course of time you’d return the compliment!

*Enter TORTENSSEN*

**TORTENSSEN.** Erling, congratulate me! I’ve just received my patent of appointment as Personal
Physician to His Majesty King Christian. I have let my house, sold my practice,
and I start for Copenhagen this day week!

**ERLING.** My dear friend, I’m overjoyed. I’m in daily expectation of a Royal command to
take up my office as Sculptor Extraordinary to the Royal Family — and we’ll
travel together. Of course, you’ve heard that I’ve been promised a Countship?

**TORTENSSEN.** And I am to be created a Baron!

**ERLING.** You don’t say so! To think that we two, who have toiled in obscurity from
boyhood for a bare subsistence, should both be raised at the same moment to such
social and professional distinction!

**TORTENSSEN.** It seems incredible! It can’t be — but, no — that’s out of the question.

**ERLING.** What can’t be?

**TORTENSSEN.** It can’t be one of Governor Griffenfeld’s practical jokes?

**ERLING.** My dear fellow, don’t suggest such a thing. It would be too cruel — why, it
would be our ruin!

**TORTENSSEN.** But he is cruel. When a scheme for a practical joke enters his head he sticks at
nothing in its accomplishment. Why, he has caused the very soldiers of the 
garrison — war-worn veterans as they are — to be drilled as ballet-girls, and to
perform all their evolutions to dance steps, simply in order to make them
ridiculous in the eyes of the girls they’re engaged to!

**ERLING.** He’s a malicious devil enough, but he would hardly venture to play pranks in the
name of his Sovereign. Besides, there’s the statue — a commission from the
King.

**TORTENSSEN.** True. By the way, I suppose it is a commission from the King? That’s not one of
his Excellency’s practical jokes?

**ERLING.* Nonsense! Now, does that look like a practical joke? Why, I’m to get ten
thousand rix-dollars for it! Now, as you know, I love his daughter Nanna
devotedly, and she has hitherto treated me with contempt, because, as she says,
I’m a mere tuppenny-halfpenny stonecutter. Of course, that’s only her humorous
way of putting it.

**TORTENSSEN.** And I adore Thora, who has always treated my pretensions with derision, because,
as she says, I’m only a pitiful pill-roller. That’s her epigrammatic way of
expressing it.

**ERLING.** But now that our positions are so immensely improved, surely we might renew
our proposals with every prospect of success!

**TORTENSSEN.** The very idea that occurred to me! My incomparable Thora ——

**ERLING.** Your what!

**TORTENSSEN.** My incomparable Thora ——

**ERLING.** Ah — exactly! But — don’t think me inquisitive — why don’t you think Nanna
incomparable?

**TORTENSSEN.** Why, my dear fellow, if for no other reason, because you do.

**ERLING.** What an obstinate dog you must be to refuse to consider her the divinest creature
in the world, because I do! And you call yourself my friend!

**TORTENSSEN.** Well, but really

**ERLING.** It’s most unjust to the poor girl.

**TORTENSSEN.** But if I loved Nanna you’d call me out.

**ERLING.** What, you — call you out? Call out my old friend because he was of the same
way of thinking as myself? — no!

**TORTENSSEN.** But suppose I were successful?

**ERLING.** Ah, but you wouldn’t be. That is a contingency that we need not consider. Now
do give up Thora and love Nanna — do, to oblige me.

**TORTENSSEN.** Do you want everybody to love Nanna?

**ERLING.** Of course I do. What I want is that all the world shall go mad over her, and that I
shall be triumphant. Surely that’s an intelligible position! Now mark: —
