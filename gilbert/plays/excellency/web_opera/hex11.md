My wedded life
Must every pleasure bring
On scale extensive! —
If I’m your wife
I must have everything
That’s most expensive —
A lady’s maid —
(My hair alone to do
I am not able) —
And I’m afraid
I’ve been accustomed to
A first-rate table.
These things one must consider when one marries —
And everything I wear must come from Paris!
Oh, think of that! Oh, think of that!
I can’t wear anything that’s not from Paris!
From top to toes
Quite Frenchified I am,
If you examine.
And then — who knows? —
Perhaps some day a fam —
Perhaps a famine!
My argument’s correct, if you examine,
What should we do, if there should come a f-famine!
Though in green pea
Yourself you needn’t stint
In July sunny,
In Januaree
It really costs a mint —
A mint of money!
No lamb for us —
House lamb at Christmas sells
At prices handsome:
Asparagus,
In winter, parallels
A Monarch’s ransom.
When purse to bread and butter barely reaches,
What is your wife to do for hot-house peaches?
Ah! tell me that! Ah! tell me that!
What is your wife to do for hot-house peaches?
Your heart and hand
Though at my feet you lay,
All others scorning! 
As matters stand,
There’s nothing else to say
Except — good morning!
Though virtue be a husband’s best adorning,
That won’t pay rates and taxes — so, good morning!
*Exit NANNA.*
