#### &nbsp;
When I bestow my bosom’s store,
No room for doubt
Must I descry:
All men must love whom I adore,
Or we fall out,
All men and I. 
Though poor their chance and slight their hope
Who with my suit presume to cope,
Yet must all men to gain her try,
Or we fall out, all men and I.
When I am wed I’ll hold them cheap
Who sing and shout
With joyous cry.
At such a time all men must weep,
Or we fall out,
All men and I.
As all men must my rivals be,
When Nanna gives her hand to me,
All men must, broken-hearted, sigh,
Or we fall out, all men and I.
If I my lady vainly woo
And, her without,
I pine and die,
Mankind at large must perish, too,
Or we fall out,
Mankind and I.
Who loves when I find life too long
Would seem to say that I am wrong.
When I expire, all men must die,
Or we fall out, all men and I!
