#### NANNA.
If all is as you say —
If honour and wealth and glory
Of every sort
Are yours —
#### THORA.
In short,
If you’re not telling a story —
#### NANNA.
If you’re a Count some day —
#### THORA.
A Baron if you’re created —
And all turns out
Beyond all doubt
Precisely as you’ve stated —
#### NANNA.
Court sculptor and a peer,
With eversomuch a year,
Precisely as you’ve stated —
#### THORA.
Physician to the King
With honours and everything,
Precisely as you’ve stated —
#### NANNA and THORA.
Then I will be your bride —
#### ERLING and TORTENSSEN.
Oh joy!
#### NANNA and THORA.
And I your bride will be!
#### ERLING and TORTENSSEN.
Then let us make merry,
It’s evident, very,
That day we soon shall see —
#### NANNA and THORA.
When you are qualified —
#### ERLING and TORTENSSEN.
Oh joy!
#### NANNA and THORA.
To marry you we agree!
#### ERLING and TORTENSSEN.
Oh happy decision!
Oh vision Elysian!
That day we soon shall see!
#### ERLING.
Compared with our own
All others are inkiness!
#### TORTENSSEN.
They are, alone,
Two visions of pinkiness!
#### ERLING.
Pinkiness, veiled
With ivory pellicle —
#### TORTENSSEN.
Everywhere hailed
As simply angelical! 
#### NANNA.
That isn’t true.
Ridiculous chatterer!
#### THORA.
Go along, do,
Unscrupulous flatterer!
#### NANNA.
Only a sweet
Individuality!
#### THORA.
Dainty and neat,
But merely mortality!
#### ERL and TORT.
Merely mortality? Merely mortality?
With such a bewitching individuality?
#### NAN and THO.
Merely too pretty young ladies of quality,
Piquante and pleasant — but merely mortality!
#### ALL.
Then I/you will be your bride — oh joy!
And I your/you my bride will be! etc.

*Dance and exeunt ERLING and TORTENSSEN.*
