## Dialogue following No. 2

*Enter NANNA and THORA*

**NANNA** *(pretending not to see ERLING and TORTENSSEN).* And they’re so clever, said I — such
talented young men — so extraordinarily good-looking, too — and so kind to
their poor old mothers!

**THORA.** And now that they’re going to be raised to the peerage they’ll have nothing to say
to a couple of middle-class nobodies like us! *(Suddenly.)* Oh my goodness, here
they are! Oh what have I said!
