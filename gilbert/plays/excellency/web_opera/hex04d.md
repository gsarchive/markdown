## Dialogue following No. 4

**NANNA.** Oh, Thora! *(laughing.)*

**THORA.** Oh, Nanna! *(laughing.)*

**NANNA.** They believe it all!

**THORA.** Every word!

**NANNA.** What geese!

**THORA.** Personal Physician to the King!

**NANNA.** Sculptor Extraordinary to the Royal Family!

**THORA.** It serves them right for presuming to aspire to our affections. It was papa’s idea!
Oh, it’s a grand thing to have a father who will condescend to play practical jokes
on the very meanest rather than allow the family dignity to be insulted.

**NANNA.** Dear papa! He has such humour!

**THORA.** So much invention!

**NANNA.** Such an uncontrollable flow of animal spirits!

**THORA.** Such a gentle, harmless, refined, and utterly inoffensive notion of fun! Here he
comes, attended by his guard — all drilled as ballet-girls. Now there’s a happy
idea!

**NANNA.** Delightful! Dear papa is never so happy as when he is making dignified people
ridiculous!
