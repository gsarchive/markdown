## Dialogue following No. 15

Enter SYNDIC, now dressed in GRIFFENFELD’s uniform.

**SYNDIC.** When a man is promoted unexpectedly to a position of the highest official
distinction, it is always a satisfactory circumstance when his figure is calculated
to set off his uniform to advantage. *(SENTRY presents arms to him.)* Eh? Oh,
thank you very much. You’re extremely polite, I’m sure!

**SENTRY.** Please to remember the sentry.

**SYNDIC.** Eh? Oh, certainly. *(Gives him money.)*

*Enter DAME CORTLANDT unobserved. She comes forward*

**DAME** *(putting her arm round him).* Mats! Little man!

**SYNDIC.** Eh? Oh, it’s you. Don’t. I’m busy now *(Aside.)* It was all very well when I was
only a Syndic, but as a Governor I can look a good deal higher than this sort of
person. *(Aloud, to sentry.)* Will you kindly do that again?

**SENTRY.** Certainly. *(Presents arms.)*

**SYNDIC.** Most gratifying, I’m sure! *(Tips him again. DAME again embraces SYNDIC.)* Now,
don’t worry — can’t you see that I have business with a gentleman? *(Reverts to
sentry.)*

**DAME** *(suppressing her rage with difficulty).* Mats! Take care! This is strange treatment — at the
very outset of our engagement!

**SYNDIC.** But, my good soul, you speak of our engagement as if ——

**DAME.** Don’t deny it, Mats. I have your letter of proposal in my pocket — you have my
letter of acceptance in yours! I’m trying to keep it down, Mats.

**SYNDIC.** But as you very properly observed, that wasn’t addressed to me but to the exGovernor.

**DAME.** It does just as well for you, Mats. I accepted the Governor, and you are the
Governor.

**SYNDIC.** If it comes to that, you were proposed to by the Syndic, and I’m not the Syndic.
Go find the Syndic — go seek, go find — there’s a good girl! *(Reverts to sentry.)*
Will you oblige me once more? *(Giving him money.)*

**DAME** *(heaving with suppressed rage).* I’m doing my best to subdue it, Mats, but it’s a
tremendous effort.

**SYNDIC.** Hold your breath and count six, my dear.

**DAME** *(does so).* It’s all right, dear — it’s down again!

**SYNDIC** *(occupied with sentry).* So glad!

**DAME.** We must settle this at once, Mats. It’s a very nice point. Shall we refer it to
arbitration?

**SYNDIC.** By all means. I find this gentleman *(indicating sentry)* full of delicate
appreciation — suppose we leave it to him?

**DAME.** You will undertake to abide by the result, Mats?

**SYNDIC.** With pleasure. *(Aside.)* I’ve tipped him till he doesn’t know whether he stands on
his head or his heels!
