## Dialogue following No. 5

**HAROLD** *(to Soldiers).* You can halt for a moment. The Governor’s stopped to make a butter
slide on the Syndic’s doorstep. *(Soldiers halt — to BLANCA.)* It’s a little unkind to
laugh at us, Blanca, for you know we can’t help it — from 10 to 2.

**BLANCA.** It’s a little unkind to complain of our laughing at you, for you know we can’t help
it — from 10 to 2.

**ELSA.** We can none of us help it — you’re all so ridiculous!

**HAROLD.** I think my betrothed wife might sympathize with the absurdity of my position. I
think all our betrothed wives might sympathize with the absurdity of all our
positions.

**ELSA.** We sympathize with you as hard as we can, after 2. We can’t do it before 2,
because we’re laughing all the time.

**BLANCA.** From 2 to 10 you’re men, and we’re engaged to you. From 10 to 2 you’re
hoppedegigs, and it’s off.

**ELSA.** That exactly describes it.

**HAROLD.** Yes, but at that rate we shall never get any forrarder. Besides, who knows what
may happen from 10 to 2? You might get engaged to somebody else — to the
Sergeant-Major, for instance — he’s always fooling around you.

**BLANCA.** Well, of course we don’t want to waste our mornings; but even if I were engaged
to him from 10 to 2, 1 should always be true to you from 2 to 10.

**HAROLD.** It’s not enough. It’s incomplete.

**ELSA.** Take care, the Governor’s coming.

**HAROLD.** Oh, confound it — off we go again! *(Soldiers resume dancing.)*

*Enter GOVERNOR GRIFFENFELD. He has a pound of butter in his hand.*

**GRIFFENFELD** *(to Soldiers).* Ah, my fine fellows, still at it? Got your second wind? That’s right
—capital exercise! Nothing like it. Here, you can eat this — I’ve done with it.
*(Giving butter to HAROLD.)* The Syndic went down like a shot!

**HAROLD** *(dancing).* I beg your Excellency’s pardon, but — may we halt for a moment? We’ve
danced for nearly three miles uphill, and it’s a hot day, and we’re feeling a little
faint.

**GRIFFENFELD.** Always craving for some unreasonable indulgence! Selfish dogs, all of you! Well,
you may halt for five minutes.

**HAROLD.** Thank you very much. *(To Soldiers.)* Selfish dogs — Halt! *(They halt.)*

**GRIFFENFELD.** Anything else?

**HAROLD.** Well, I have a request to make. The fact is, the troops do feel the humiliation of
being drilled like ballet-girls.

**GRIFFENFELD.** Bless my heart, you surprise me! Don’t they like ballet-girls?

**HAROLD.** Oh, they’re very fond of ballet-girls, but they don’t want to be ballet-girls,
because when you are a ballet-girl, you don’t seem to care so much about balletgirls as you do when — when you’re something quite different.

**GRIFFENFELD.** But don’t your men see how much amusement they create? Can’t they see that all
the girls are laughing at them? Have they no sense of humour?

**HAROLD.** Oh, they’ve a distinct sense of humour; but to enjoy this sort of thing completely
you want to see it from a distance. You see it from a distance, and it ought to be
devilish funny; but we are close to it — in fact, we are it — and when you are it,
you don’t seem to care so much about it, as you do when — when you are
something quite different. The fact is, the point of a joke is like the point of a
needle — hold the needle sideways and it’s plain enough, but when it is directed
straight at you — well, it’s not always very easy to see the point of it.

**GRIFFENFELD.** Nonsense! I can see a joke plain enough even when I’m its victim. Take my
unfortunate love affair —

**HAROLD.** Ah, ridiculous business that! *(Soldiers laugh.)*

**GRIFFENFELD.** No comments, sir!

**HAROLD** *(to Soldiers).* No comments, gentlemen!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Take my unfortunate love affair. The late Governor, when I was only his deputy,
was about to be married to an elderly lady of a singularly explosive disposition.
They simply doted on each other. Now when you see two old donkeys simply
doting on each other, your course is obvious — you set to work —

**HAROLD.** To wheedle the old lady —

**GRIFFENFELD.** Away from the old gentleman.

**HAROLD.** Ha! ha! you little rogue! *(HAROLD digs GRIFFENFELD in the ribs.)*

**GRIFFENFELD.** Don’t do that, sir!

**HAROLD** *(to Soldiers).* Don’t do that, gentlemen!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Well, after some respectful attention, she accepted me in this letter *(producing a
letter)* in which she stipulated that the matter should be kept a profound secret
until an excuse could be found for sending the old gentleman about his business.
But, as luck would have it, the Governor died suddenly and I succeeded him,
before I had time to explain that it was only my fun —

**HAROLD and SOLDIERS.** Ha! ha! *(Suddenly serious.)* I beg your pardon — I don’t know what
they’re laughing at.

**GRIFFENFELD.** And so there I was — regularly trapped into a ridiculous engagement, which I
can’t for the life of me see my way out of. The situation is most unpleasant —
most unpleasant. But do you suppose I don’t see the fun of it? Why, I can’t think
of it without going into convulsions! Ha! ha!

**HAROLD and SOLDIERS.** Ha! ha! ha!

**GRIFFENFELD.** She’s sixty!

**HAROLD and SOLDIERS.** Ha! ha! ha!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Wears a wig!

**HAROLD and SOLDIERS.** Ha! ha! ha!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Don’t overdo it, sir!

**HAROLD.** Don’t overdo it, gentlemen!

**GRIFFENFELD.** That’s quite enough. It’s a very good joke, but not as good a joke as all that.
Impudent puppies! — be off with you.

**HAROLD** *(to SOLDIERS).* Impudent puppies! — inwards turn — Chassez!

*HAROLD and SOLDIERS dance off, followed by girls laughing and chattering.*

**GRIFFENFELD.** Upon my word, there’s no such thing as gratitude. I do all I can to make my
soldiers amusing — I place them in all kinds of ridiculous situations — I make
them a source of entertainment to a whole township of attractive girls, and instead
of being pleased and grateful for the attention, they growl like so many sore-eared
bears!

*Enter DAME CORTLANDT skittishly, with a folded note in her hand*

**DAME.** Why, here’s my little man after all! I’ve been looking for him everywhere. Why
does he hide himself away from his loving Hecla?

**GRIFFENFELD.** Eh? Oh, it’s you, is it? *(She puts her arm round his neck.)* Don’t do that — you
rumple me. What have you got there?

**DAME.** It’s a note, you jealous boy! Not for you — oh dear no! it’s a pretty little pink and
white billet doux addressed to a pretty little pink and white gentleman, begging
him to make an appointment to meet a pretty little pink and white lady, all alone!
That’s me! Now what do you think of that?

**GRIFFENFELD.** Well, if you ask me, I don’t think he’ll come.

**DAME.** Oh yes, he will! He’ll come fast enough. But there — it’s cruel to keep my pet in
suspense — 

**GRIFFENFELD.** God bless me, you don’t suppose I care whom you meet!

**DAME** *(suddenly furious).* What’s that? Say that again! Once more! Come, out with it!

**GRIFFENFELD** *(alarmed).* I say that I’ve such perfect confidence in your moral character that I
don’t trouble myself to inquire whom you make appointments with.

**DAME** *(relieved).* Oh, was that all? But you shouldn’t upset me, George. Within this fragile
body two tremendous powers are in perpetual antagonism — a Diabolical Temper
and an Iron Will. At first it didn’t seem to be any affair of mine, and I determined
to let them fight it out among themselves; but this internal conflict of irresistible
forces is very wearing, George, and I begin to wish they’d settle it one way or the
other.

**GRIFFENFELD.** Oh, what’s the odds?

**DAME** *(temper rising).* About seven to two on the Temper just now, George. *(Struggling to
repress it.)* No, the Will triumphs! *(Playfully.)* Now, shall I tell my little man who
it is? *(Placing her arm round his neck.)*

**GRIFFENFELD.** Oh, bother! Don’t go on like that! You’re too old!

**DAME** *(suddenly furious).* Eh? What was that? Too old! I’m too old! Oh, hold me down — hold
me down! Bottle me up, and tie down the cork, or I shall go mad! mad! mad!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Don’t go on like that — it’s so jumpy!

**DAME** *(struggling with herself).* You — you said I was too old!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Well, I’m too old. You’re not, but I am. Can’t you take a joke? Can’t anybody
take a joke?

**DAME.** You were not in earnest?

**GRIFFENFELD.** Earnest! Am I ever in earnest?

**DAME** *(with an effort).* All right, dear — don’t be afraid — it’s down again! Well, then, this is
a letter requesting Master Mats Munck, the Syndic, to take my instructions for
drawing up the settlements with a view to my forth-coming marriage. But I shan’t
tell you how I’m going to deal with my property. That will be a little surprise for
you during the honeymoon.

**GRIFFENFELD** *(aside).* A letter to the Syndic? The very thing! It may help me to carry out my plot
for compromising her with him. *(Aloud.)* Give it to me. I shall see him presently,
and I’ll hand it to him.

**DAME.** To be sure I will. *(Giving it to him.)* And now about the date.

**GRIFFENFELD.** What date?

**DAME.** Why, the date of our marriage, you ardent creature!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Oh, yes! — come and sit down, and we’ll talk it over. *(She sits at his feet.)* There
— like that. Cosy, isn’t it?

**DAME** *(shyly).* Oh, George!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Now suppose — I only say suppose, you know —

**DAME.** Yes — like a fairy tale.

**GRIFFENFELD.** Exactly like a fairy tale. Now suppose that one fine morning you discovered that
all this lovemaking of mine was only one of my practical jokes! Ha! ha! ha!

**DAME.** Ha! ha! ha! *(working herself up into a rage).* Stop a bit! stop a bit! They’re
fighting it out.

**GRIFFENFELD** *(earnestly).* Two to one on the Will! Two to one on the Will!

**DAME.** Wins easy, George! It’s all right again. Go on, dear.

**GRIFFENFELD.** No, but really now, what would you say if you found out, quite unexpectedly, that
I wasn’t in earnest, and that I only proposed to you because — because somebody
bet me I wouldn’t?

**DAME** *(working herself up).* Bet you you wouldn’t — bet you you wouldn’t! What would I do —
what would I do — what would I do?

**GRIFFENFELD.** Now don’t go on like that! It’s most unpleasant. I don’t think you know how
creepy you are when you do that. Oh, Lord, she’s off again!
