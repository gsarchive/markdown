## Dialogue following No. 16


**GRIFFENFELD** *(alone).* It’s alright! they’re both committed to it, and that little difficulty is off
my hands at last! Hallo! what’s wrong now?

*Enter NANNA and THORA tidying their caps and much out of temper.*

**THORA.** Papa, a joke’s a joke — but I don’t think it fair to make us plot against ourselves!

**NANNA.** I’m sure I enjoy a hit of fun as much as anybody, but when it comes to our being
coupled, if only for an afternoon, with a brace of penniless admirers, who are
disposed to take every advantage of the position in which they temporarily find
themselves, why, it’s going a little too far — that’s all!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Why, what have they been doing?

**THORA.** Why, they’ve been unnecessarily realistic in their attentions.

**GRIFFENFELD.** Unpleasantly so?

**THORA.** I said unnecessarily so. Goodness knows, I don’t mind realism when there’s any
prospect of its coming to anything definite, but as neither of these young men has
a penny, the sooner it’s put a stop to the better!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Hasn’t a penny! What are you talking about? Why, they’re magnificent matches
— Court Physician with the rank of Baron! Sculptor Extraordinary to the Royal
Family with the title of Count! Why, you grasping girls, what more do you want?

**NANNA.** Oh, papa! that’s all nonsense! If these persons were really what they believe
themselves to be, we wouldn’t mind, but as they’re both penniless young men,
and we are penniless young ladies, the sooner we tell them the truth, the better.

**GRIFFENFELD.** But, my good girls, consider! Don’t go and spoil it all! Think of the fun of it when
they discover how they’ve been cheated! Oh, my dear girls, there’s a rich and rare
treat in store for us all!

*The girls, who have been chuckling through his speech, burst into hearty laughter.*

**THORA.** Upon my word, it ought to be extremely amusing!
