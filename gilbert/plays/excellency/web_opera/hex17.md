#### GRIFFENFELD.
When a gentleman supposes that he comfortably dozes on a pleasant bed of
roses (which are singularly rare) —
#### NANNA.
And discovers that it bristles with uncomfortable thistles, in intemperate
epistles his annoyance he’ll declare —
#### THORA.
When a man his temper loses his remarks he never chooses, but expressive
language uses, with a tendency to swear —
#### GRIFFENFELD.
And when lovers are discarded their upbraiding will be larded with some
epithets unguarded — you had better not be there!
#### NANNA *(disappointed).*
We had better not be there?
#### THORA *(disappointed).*
We had better not be there?
#### GRIFFENFELD *(decidedly).*
You had better not be there!
#### ALL.
We/You had better not be there!
#### NANNA and THORA.
&nbsp;
When these gentlemen conceited both discover they’ve been cheated, all our
fun will be defeated — that’s a thing we couldn’t bear —
So, however you may rave it, we’ll unquestionably brave it; you may take
your affidavit we will certainly be there!
#### ALL.
We/They will certainly be there —
We/They will certainly be there! —
Though you/I flout it, never doubt it, we/they will certainly be there!
#### GRIFFENFELD.
Their despair and their distraction and their keen dissatisfaction — their
exaggerated action, and the tearing of their hair —
#### NANNA.
Their disgust and desperation when they see the situation some congenial
occupation for the lawyers will prepare —
#### THORA.
We shall find their loud abusing both intrusive and amusing, and of violent
accusing there’ll be symptoms in the air —
#### GRIFFENFELD.
And their libellous expressions and their angry indiscretions will be tried at
Quarter Sessions, when I occupy the chair!
#### NANNA *(gleefully).*
When you occupy the chair —
#### THORA *(gleefully).*
When you occupy the chair —
#### ALL.
When/I you occupy the chair —
#### GRIFFENFELD.
When the case is quite completed, then the prisoner defeated with severity is
treated as you’re probably aware —
For it’s awfully provided that the jury will be guided by my summary one-sided — which distresses Labouchere.
#### ALL.
It is rough on Labouchere —
It is rough on Labouchere —
Oh, the dickens, how it sickens tender-hearted Labouchere!

*Exit GRIFFENFELD*
