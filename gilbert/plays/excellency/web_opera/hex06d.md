## Dialogue following No. 6


**GRIFFENFELD.** This is getting a little too hot to be pleasant. But this letter to the Syndic is simply
providential. It’s exactly what I wanted to make my innocent little plot complete
*(tears it up)*. Now where are those two girls of mine? They ought to be back by
this time. *(Enter NANNA and THORA.)* Oh, here you are! Well, have you seen the
Syndic?

**NANNA.** Yes, and we’ve carried out all your instructions.

**GRIFFENFELD.** Good girls.

**NANNA.** We told him that we had the best possible reason to know that the wealthy old
lady was particularly well disposed towards him, and that a declaration from him
would receive polite and immediate attention.

**THORA.** So the silly old gentleman went off his head with joy — did extraordinary things
with the office-stool, and at once wrote his declaration, and gave to us to deliver
*(produces it)*. Here it is.

**GRIFFENFELD.** Thank you *(giving her the letter which he formerly received from DAME
CORTLANDT)*. The old lady’s reply.

**THORA.** What, already?

**NANNA.** Wonderful invention, steam!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Hush! *(Aside to them.)* It’s the very letter in which she accepted me under seal of
secrecy, when I was only Deputy Governor!

**NANNA.** Oh, you sly old papa!

**GRIFFENFELD.** Ha! ha! ha! It will do for him just as well as it did for me, and it will make him so
happy!
