#### DAME.
Now what would I do if you proved untrue,
and the suit you pressed were an idle jest,
and the conjugal yoke a brainless joke,
and if marry your darling your couldn’t?
#### GRIFFENFELD.
Yes, what would you do if I proved untrue,
And if marry my darling I couldn’t?
#### DAME.
What would I do if you owned some day that,
a wager to win, you had taken me in,
and the fact disclosed that you just proposed
because somebody bet you you wouldn’t?
#### GRIFFENFELD.
If I owned some day that I sang that lay,
Because somebody bet me I wouldn’t?
#### DAME.
Why the trembling rock from an earthquake’s shock,
and the ocean’s roar on the rock-bound shore,
and the hell-babe’s scream were a peaceful
dream, to the terrible broth of my brewing;
The tiger’s gnash, and the cut-throat’s gash, and the foeman’s clash,
and the thunder-crash of eternal smash were unmeaning trash,
compared with my hullaballoing!

#### ENSEMBLE.
&nbsp;

| GRIFFENFELD *(aside).* | DAME. |
|------------------------|-------|
| It might, perhaps, be rather rash | Take care, you’ll find it rather rash |
| The truth upon her mind to flash | My matrimonial hopes to dash, |
| If an earthquake’s shock were idle trash | For an earthquake’s shock were idle trash |
| Compared with her hullaballoing! | Compared with my hullaballoing! |

#### DAME.
Like grey screech-owl (that hideous fowl) in midnight cowl
I’d slink and prowl till a horrible howl and a tiger’s growl
had told the world I’d found you!

With abject fell and a yelp and yell,
on Vengeance’s wing at my foe I’d spring,
and face to face in a close embrace
I’d wind my arms around you!
Your heart I’d tear from its loathsome lair —
I’d pluck out your eyes, and your tongue likewise —
and limb from limb, with a growling grin,
I’d rend him who pooh-poohs me!

*(recovering herself).*
Excuse me, please — when people tease, by slow degrees
I kick up a breeze which you can’t appease —
it’s quite a disease — I’ll go and lie down — excuse me!

*Exit DAME CORTLANDT.*
