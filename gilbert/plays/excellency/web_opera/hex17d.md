## Dialogue following No. 17


**NANNA.** Really, Thora, I can’t help feeling rather conscience-stricken. Poor boys! I’m
really afraid we’ve broken their hearts.

**THORA.** It’s a pity they’re such nobodies. I sometimes think between ourselves ——

**NANNA.** Hush! So do I — but here they come.

*Enter ERLING and TORTENSSEN. The girls retire up stage and listen*

**TORTENSSEN.** Do you know, I don’t care to be repulsed by a girl I’m engaged to, Count.

**ERLING.** They certainly treated us very coldly, Baron. Mere innocent attention — such as
every girl expects from the man she’s going to marry ——

**TORTENSSEN.** Remember, Count, we are no longer a couple of adventurers, we are great men,
and we are entitled to expect that attentions shall be paid to us, now. *(Girls
indulge in suppressed chuckles.)* I think a little condescension on our part, a little
stand-offishness, an air of doing them a considerable favour, would not be
misplaced.

**ERLING.** I see what you mean, Baron. A little of this sort of thing — “Good-day to you, my
dear; good day to you. Pleased to see you, pleased to see you ——”

**TORTENSSEN.** “A little further off, please. We’ll tell you when we want the mixture as before.”
Don’t you think so, Count?

**ERLING.** I really think it’s only what is due to us, Baron, I do indeed.

*The Girls come forward pretending to weep bitterly.*

**NANNA** *(in affected tears).* Oh, please, we’ve been thinking it over, and we’re very sorry we were
so un-kuk-kuk-kuk-kind to you just now.

**ERLING** *(condescendingly).* Thank you, thank you. Pray don’t name it.

**TORTENSSEN.** We thought you’d like a little attention — but it’s not of the smallest
consequence. There — go away — there’s good girls.

**THORA** *(pretending to sob).* Oh, but we did like it-only — *(Bursts into tears.)*

**NANNA** *(sobbing).* We thought it more mai-mai-maidenly to be cuc-cuc-cuc-coy! *(Tears.)* By
such a par-par-particular pa-pa-papa!

**THORA.** And we’re so afraid of Mrs. Gug-gug-gug-Grundy! *(Violent burst of tears.)*

*Both burst into floods of tears.*

| | *Together.*
|-|-
| **ERL.** | Now, my darling child — Nanna dearest — don’t cry like that! I can’t bear it! See, on my knees I swear to you that I will always — always love you as I love you now! Oh, don’t cry like that — you’ll break my heart — indeed you will!
| **TORT.** | My dearest Thora — you mustn’t — really you mustn’t! It’s dreadful to see those pretty eyes so red with weeping — Oh, I was a brute to be unkind to you, there —don’t be a little goose! I didn’t mean it — upon my word I didn’t!

*Both men are on their knees trying to console the two girls. The girls, who have been pretending
to weep hysterically through this, suddenly burst into peals of hearty laughter.*

**ERLING** *(springing up).* Tortenssen, I do believe they’re laughing at us!

**THORA.** Oh, aren’t the nobility shrewd!

**NANNA.** And isn’t the aristocracy quick at grasping a situation!
