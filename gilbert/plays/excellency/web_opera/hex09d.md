## Dialogue following No. 9

*Enter the SYNDIC, with DAME CORTLANDT’s letter in his hand*

**SYNDIC.** It’s a singular thing, but I never yet proposed to a very unattractive old lady
without being immediately accepted. Now here is an unattractive old lady —
about to be married to no less a personage than the Governor of this Province, and
I have only to beckon to her, and down comes the confiding, old dove with no
further thought about the governor, except to stipulate that her change of intention
shall be kept a secret from him for the present! Here comes the old dear, true to
the appointment of her own making. How — how rich she looks, to be sure!

*Enter DAME CORTLANDT.*

**DAME** *(bashfully).* Master Munck — I — I ventured to send you a letter this morning.

**SYNDIC.** A most delightful letter, and one that, believe me, I shall prize while I live!

**DAME** *(surprised).* You are vastly obliging! *(Aside.)* Collecting autographs, I suppose. *(Aloud.)*
Now, you will understand that, for the reasons explained in my letter, I am most
anxious that the subject of our conversation shall be kept a profound secret.

**SYNDIC.** Madam, I will be most careful. You — you are the discreetest little gipsy in
Denmark!

**DAME.** Sir!

**SYNDIC.** Quite right — can’t be too cautious, even between ourselves. I quite grasp the
idea.

**DAME** *(aside).* He is singularly effusive for a confidential family lawyer! *(Aloud.)* I daresay that
you are aware that I am well to do.

**SYNDIC.** Well, I certainly have heard that Dame Cortlandt is a lady of some means — but
oh, she does her lover a grave injustice if she imagines that he allowed a
mercenary consideration to influence him.

**DAME** *(surprised).* Why, of course I know that!

**SYNDIC.** Such a dainty, tight, trim, bewitching little rogue requires no ——

**DAME** *(suddenly furious).* Eh? What’s that? I’m a little rogue! This man presumes to tell me
that I am a little rogue!

**SYNDIC.** But, my dear lady —

**DAME.** Don’t speak — they’re fighting it out — they’re fighting it out!

**SYNDIC.** Bless my heart, how very interesting!

**DAME** *(having swallowed her anger — severely).* It’s all right, Master Munck, and, for the
moment, the Tempter is floored, but don’t try that again. Perhaps — perhaps we 
had better discuss my affairs at another time — when you have slept it off,
whatever it is.

**SYNDIC.** No, don’t go — let me gaze a little longer on — *(DAME about to break out.)* I
didn’t say it! I didn’t say it! I stopped in time!

**DAME** *(aside).* He’s very eccentric for a confidential family lawyer! *(Aloud.)* I wish you to take
instructions about the settlements on the occasion of — *(bashfully)* my
forthcoming marriage.

**SYNDIC.** My dear lady! *(Takes out notebook.)*

**DAME.** There are my two freehold farms, the three houses in Dentheim, and twelve
thousands rix-dollars in Government securities. I wish to settle all this, absolutely,
on my dear husband.

**SYNDIC.** What, all!!!

**DAME.** Every penny.

**SYNDIC.** Dearest! *(DAME about to break out again. SYNDIC checks himself.)* I didn’t say it!
I didn’t say it! I thought it, but I didn’t say it!
